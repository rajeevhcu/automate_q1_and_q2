Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Good day, everyone and thanks for joining us on our call today. This quarter, we relaunched Square for Retail with an applet model. This allows us to add features like invoices that were originally developed for Square Point of Sale directly to Square for Retail. We've been talking about omni-channel for quite some time. This quarter, we launched the new Square Online Store and we made it, so that it has automatic syncing of both online and in-person data. So, Square Online Store launched in Australia, Canada, the UK and the United States. Square Invoices launched in all of our markets at once. Two, we have -- we launched a Square Stand and our Square contactless and chip card reader in Japan. This is a huge upgrade from the reader that we had in the market in the past. It allows our sellers to automatically pair wirelessly or through a wire. It allows them to hold their iPad and hook it up to the new Square Reader. So now, any one of our Japanese sellers to be can go to the local bank branch, pick up the Square card reader and be in business, and it is at parity with what we offer in the United States, and our other markets. Second, we continue to build out our seller ecosystem, including the launch of Square Invoices as a stand-alone app and third, we are raising revenue guidance for the full year 2019 on the basis of strong underlying trends across our business. Second, we continue to build out our seller ecosystem. The proof point this most recent quarter was the launch of Square Invoices as a stand-alone app. We began invoices five years ago as a feature in our dashboard, then added it to the Square Point of Sale app and now we've expanded the offering with a dedicated stand-alone mobile app. We also saw strength with Square Capital with originations growing 50% year-over-year based on the core Flex Loan products. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman And Darrin, this is Jack. On Square Card, just to remind everyone, this is a card that we enable sellers to receive. And basically it allows them to download the Square Point of Sale and get a place to store their money and also a card that's Mastercard branded that they can use anywhere. So, basically they don't have to make a trip to the bank just to get into business, which is pretty cool. And we -- one of the biggest reasons we did Square Card was to give our sellers faster access to their funds. So we found in our early pilot that over 40% of Square Card sellers did not previously have a business debit card. So they're actually mixing their business funds for their shop with personal funds. So this also allows them to segment those funds. The early read on this just one interesting metric that we can share is that, active Square Card sellers are spending over 20% of their GPV through the card. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Ciancaglini, a Square seller. Again I'm a Square seller, The name of my business is Chank's Pizza Cones. We actually serve pizza in a cone shape and my question is, so we you Square Payroll and I'm also a Square shareholder and I'm just I'm curious to know your strategy for adding payroll to the Square services. Was it mainly because you see an ability to drive additional revenue through users that use Square now, are you focusing on capturing new users as more of a strategic move for bigger market share? Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Thank you. Thank you for the question, Eric, and thanks for using Square. And then secondly, when we think about the build with the Square pipeline, obviously you have a really good relationship with Eventbrite where it's more of a online gateway capacity. How should we think about the pipeline of opportunities there? Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh. So, on Square Card, I don't believe we've done much in the way of traditional marketing or any sort of push outside of the product itself. So there's a number of things we can do both in terms of on boarding, but also with sellers that are currently utilizing Square to surface this much higher. On Build with Square and Eventbrite, we see Eventbrite certainly as amazing partner, but also prototype of another marketplace. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Thank you. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the further development and traction you're getting with your vertical specific software, specifically things like Square for Restaurants. On the Square for Retail side as you've probably been following, we've had to do a little bit of a reboot here. One of the things that we did well was Square for Restaurants as we took a lot of time talking with restaurant owners and operators and just really decomposed everything that they had to work with every single day. And what was frustrating them, and how we could improve it and that made a product that found some pretty significant product market fit right away. We did not do that with the original Square for Retail. So we rebooted the whole thing, following that pattern, and we're seeing some equally good results from that move. In contrast, about 85% of retail sellers, self on board versus the 65% on restaurants and nearly 40% of those sellers are new to Square, which is excellent. Our average annualized GPV of Square for Retail seller is nearly 250,000. You're seeing that play out with things like investments in hardware through Square Register and terminal, investments in software and payments with virtual terminal in invoices and scaling launches of our more recent launches like Square Card developer and online. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Yeah, Lisa. So we're also pretty pleased with the launch of Square Online Store. So far, we have seen about 70% of Square online sellers have used Square before expanding online. Amrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer We know that 30% of our larger sellers serve their customers via more than one channel on Square. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Thanks, Lisa. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Rayna, we didn't hear your full question. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman There you are. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman So I'll start there. Square Invoices, the app launch in all of our markets at once. You see that with the launch of the Square Online Store across the US, UK, Canada and Australia. Wanted to ask as Square moves up the market to the mid to large clients, I assume Square is likely replacing incumbent, so curious on what's winning versus the competition? Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Yeah, I'll start off. Whether you look at our hardware products, like Square Terminal or Square Register, both of which over-indexed to larger sellers. Square Terminal with $165,000 GPV registered with $300,000 GPV or the developer platform as Jack mentioned which over indexes to mid market sellers. Obviously your advantage in terms of linking online and offline sales to retailers and I get that's what makes Square Online Store compelling. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Yeah, we have focused more on omni-channel rather than just pure e-commerce, because that's really where our sweet spot is with sellers. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Thank you. There are -- you're suddenly waking up a lot of competitors in this space, Jack and they're investing more heavily to compete with Square. Are you seeing more competition, whether it's -- I know you've built the ecosystem and others are trying to build something similar to that, but are you seeing more competition, whether it's from Clover or TSYS or other merchant acquirers or FinTech companies? Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Yeah, I mean we are definitely seeing competition on the edges. Amrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer Bob, just on your GPV point. Amrita Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks for the question, Dan. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Well, a bit of both, if I'm understanding your question correctly. Jack Dorsey -- Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Thank you."],"author_name":"newsfeedback@fool.com (Motley Fool Transcribers)","id":"14506|newsapi.org|ee240401baaaee319b10c586763a3fd5|2","net_sentiment":"4.0","content_media_type":"newsapi.org"},{"content_published_date":"2019-04-29","text":["PayPal made veiled references to third-party data suggesting Square Inc.s SQ, +2.01% Cash app had overtaken Venmo in popularity, prompting the digital-payments pioneer to release account metrics on Venmo for the first time.

Offsetting the income related to the Great Park venture, our share of Gateway Commercial Venture's $750,000 loss was approximately $560,000 for the quarter. As previously reported in our 8-K filed in February, the retail joint venture at Candlestick was terminated and we repaid the outstanding principal of $65.1 million and interest on the outstanding promissory note held by Macerich. As a result, we were released from our obligation to convey parcels of property on which the retail project was intended to be developed by the mall Venture.

Like did you need to I guess fully end this Macerich deal before the City would start looking at these approvals? We had to wait to come to a conclusion on the Macerich agreement because the area that we are actually going to be starting our first phase in Candlestick is actually the area where the outlet model was supposed to be. And we had to wait until we came to the conclusion, we came to in terms of the unwinding of the agreement before we can move forward. We started actually in anticipation of potentially unwinding that agreement.

At Thursdays earnings call, Macerich CEO Tom OHern said it has been able to back fill 55 percent of mall spaces vacated by retailers or from those that have declared bankruptcy. Macerich?s quarter stands in contrast to mall REIT Simon Property Group, which on Tuesday reported higher earnings for the quarter. The company, which acknowledged that the continued wave of retailer bankruptcies has taken a toll, reported funds from operations of $1.08 billion in the first quarter, up from the nearly $1.03 billion in the first quarter of 2018. CFO Scott Kingsmore suggested that the company wasn?t looking back, saying some of those retailers that closed had ?no in-store experience.

The frequency down-shift is relatively large on spherical tokamaks, which have much lower toroidal fields, thus lower cyclotron frequencies, than conventional tokamaks, but similar beam ion energies. The counter-propagating CAE typically has frequencies of order half the edge deuterium ion-cyclotron frequency, consistent with the expected downshift from the co-injected neutral beams. Co-propagating CAE with frequencies up to and exceeding the edge ion-cyclotron frequency were seen on MAST4040. The resonant fast ion drive for co-propagating CAE with frequencies approaching, but below, the edge cyclotron frequency is generally not considered to be through a cyclotron resonance as the Doppler-shifted resonance condition would not be satisfied. The Mirnov coil arrays are configured to measure both poloidal and toroidal magnetic fluctuations on both NSTX and NSTX-U, the toroidal mode number of coherent modes, and provide some limited information on the poloidal structure. The ion cyclotron emission seen on NSTX/NSTX-U is similar in many ways to the ICE commonly seen in conventional aspect ratio tokamaks, with some interesting exceptions, and is qualitatively different from the CAE seen on NSTX and MAST. As with observations of ICE on higher field tokamaks, higher harmonics (up to the seventh) have been seen on NSTX/NSTX-U. This is in contrast to the CAE studied on NSTX where higher harmonics, while theoretically possible, are not seen. The wave frequency increases slightly as the density increases, rather than dropping by roughly 40% that would be expected for an Alfv?nic mode. The predicted 40% drop in frequency is supported by simulations with the CAE code.4141. In contrast, the frequencies of CAE on NSTX show a clear Alfv?nic scaling with density. Also shown are the frequencies from a representative sample of co-propagating CAE on NSTX, normalized to the edge deuterium cyclotron frequency. (Counter-propagating CAEs have lower frequencies, typically less than 0.4 fci.) The frequency of the co-propagating, high-n CAE in NSTX H-mode plasmas seldom exceeds the edge deuterium cyclotron frequency; however, in low density exceptions, at all toroidal fields, the co-propagating CAE can have frequencies higher than the edge deuterium cyclotron frequency. Similar observations were reported for co-propagating CAE in low field MAST plasmas.4040. The frequencies of the single example, so far, of CAEs in an NSTX-U shot were all above the edge ion cyclotron frequency. As for the ICE, the normalized co-propagating-CAE frequencies appear relatively constant as the toroidal field is increased, albeit with significant scatter."],"author_name":"E. D. Fredrickson, N. N.

Parent pilots his own Piper Meridian turboprop on business trips in North America. He qualified to fly a Boeing 737 by taking CAE classes and is working on a business jet rating. His sales pitch is that CAE can offer big savings by either taking over an airlines training centers and running them more efficiently or funneling its pilots through one of the programs CAE operates in 65 centers around the globe. A large carrier with in-house instruction might train 5,000 pilots a year; CAE trains 135,000 annually, as well as 85,000 flight crew members. CAE promises it can operate a training program more efficiently than an airline given its deep knowledge of its own equipment and its extensive training center network. CAE wont disclose numbers, but analysts estimate the company saves airlines 20% to 30% on training. Its been a great working relationship, says Adrian Jenkins, operations chief for AirAsia, which has grown into Asia's largest budget airline since CAE first sold the upstart Malaysia-based carrier a used Boeing 737 simulator in 2004. In 2011 they established a joint venture to train AirAsias pilots as well as those of other local airlines; in 2017, Air Asia cashed out its 50% stake to CAE and signed a 20-year training contract. Having worked with CAE for years, we trusted them with our training, says Jenkins, so AirAsia decided, Lets just focus on the airline business. Gaining that trust has been a hurdle for CAE. CAE launched a rookie pilot training program with American in 2018 and established a joint venture with Singapore Airlines to establish a training center. In the 1980s, CAE made the first simulators deemed realistic enough by U.S. regulators to allow pilots to train on them exclusively. The result: The first time the vast majority of pilots get behind the controls of an airliner today, its as co-pilot on a plane loaded with passengers. By the 1990s, CAE was riding high with a 67% share of the commercial simulator market, but the computer revolution in Silicon Valley was about to end the good times. At CAE, Brown put Parent to work in 2005 as head of the simulator division, where Parent slashed head count and production costs, putting the business back on its feet. But the experience crystalized for Parent that CAE had to diversify, a mission he has carried out with zeal since he succeeded Brown as CEO in 2009. One hurdle Parent had to clear: a perception that CAE was still primarily a hardware company. CAE surveys showed more than half of airline CEOs didnt even know the company trained pilots. Last year CAE acquired a 45% stake in Pelesys, a Vancouver-based courseware development company it had been working with, and rolled out Rise, an artificial intelligence system that evaluates students performance in simulators, picking up on little details that instructors might miss. CAE faces formidable competitors that see the same opportunity in training. Through acquisitions, the defense contractor L3 has cobbled together a civil simulator and training business that has the second-largest market share behind CAE, and Airbus and Boeing have expanded into pilot training as part of their push into higher-margin services. In the lucrative niche of business jet pilot training, CAE is going up against Flight Safety International, owned by Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway. But analysts say there should be room for all to thrive in a growing market. Airbus and Boeing may dwarf 9,000-employee CAE, but their rivalry naturally limits them in training: Boeing isnt about to teach pilots how to fly an Airbus A320. CAE has followed the same playbook in growing its defense business, which accounts for 38% of sales.

Ethernet remained an in-house technology at Xerox until 1980. In 1979, Metcalfe left Xerox to form 3Com, and convinced Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Intel, and Xerox to work together to promote Ethernet as a standard. The Graphical User Interface (Xerox PARC) How Xerox PARC transformed the computer interface The graphical user interface (GUI) allows a user to issue commands to a computer by interacting with visual elements displayed on a screen, such as icons, input windows, or labeled buttons. Xerox has faced hefty criticism for its failure to successfully commercialize the GUI. The first computer to feature a graphical user interface, the Xerox Alto, was designed for corporate and research purposes and not intended for mass commercialization. In 1979, Xerox PARC received a visit from a young tech executive by the name of Steve Jobs. Jobs and other Apple employees reportedly saw a demonstration of the technology from Xerox as part of an investment deal Xerox had made in Apple. However, as we?ve seen, their status as the go-to user interface is being challenged by the rise of voice-activated devices like the Amazon Echo. The Xerox Alto was the first computer to feature both a mouse and a graphical user interface. The Computer Mouse (Xerox PARC) How Xerox PARC stood on the shoulders of others and changed computer navigation forever Like the GUI, the computer mouse was essential in spurring the mass adoption of computers. Before the mouse, the only way to interact with a computer was by typing commands, which made them difficult and unwieldy to navigate. The introduction of the mouse and the graphical user interface, both developed at Xerox PARC, helped bring the computer from specialty tech to consumer product with broad applications and accessibility. One of the early computers to feature a mouse was the Xerox Star, introduced in 1981, but it wasn?t until the introduction of the Apple Macintosh in 1984 that the mouse saw more widespread use. The Laser Printer (Xerox PARC) How Xerox consolidated its competitive advantage with the laser printer Xerox was already the dominant player in the photocopier market in the 1960s when the idea for the laser printer was born. Gary Starkweather, a Xerox product developer, developed the first plans for a laser printer in late 1969. Two years later, Starkweather transferred to PARC, where he modified an existing Xerox copier to create the Scanned Laser Output Terminal (SLOT). The first commercial application of a laser printer came in 1975 with the IBM 3800. Xerox brought its first commercial laser printer, the Xerox 9700, to market in 1977. Over the subsequent years, office and later home printers were introduced by companies including IBM, Canon, Xerox, Apple, and Hewlett-Packard. As of 2019, printing is estimated to be a $77B business, according to IBISWorld. Laser printers, like this one from Sony, can trace their origin to Xerox PARC."],"author_name":"Animalz Team","id":"14510|newsapi.org|7029271bddff8bca50c09b6dcbebbe2d|2","net_sentiment":"-1.66667","content_media_type":"newsapi.org"},{"content_published_date":"2019-05-09","text":["Former well-regarded Xerox CEO turn Uber (UBER) board member Ursula Burns is one of the ride-sharing companys biggest assets post IPO, thinks a long-time ally.
