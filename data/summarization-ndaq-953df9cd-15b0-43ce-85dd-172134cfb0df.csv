"However, the latest Wall Street IPOs have several interesting characteristics, particularly the competition between the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq to attract new listings. This is in total contrast to what is happening on Wall Street at present. The Wall Street Journal recently reported: \"When BJ's Wholesale Club Holdings was planning its IPO last year, a team from Nasdaq Inc. descended on its headquarters in Westborough, Massachusetts, to try to persuade it to list on the exchange. \"In a conference room overlooking the freeway, Nasdaq's representatives pulled out a pitchbook thick with incentives, including a Black Friday holiday advertising spread in Times Square and a general manager gala. Nasdaq also highlights the merits of listing on its platform although in a less aggressive way than the NYSE. It opens with the assertion: \"Nasdaq is a trusted market leader and has built a financial community of world-renowned industry innovators and visionaries Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Amgen, eBay and Google\". It misses the opportunity to highlight the listing success of Mainfreight, Ryman Healthcare, Port of Tauranga, Auckland International Airport, Infratil, Trustpower and many more companies. The NZX is losing out to the ASX, which has adopted the aggressive marketing approach embraced by the NYSE and Nasdaq. Consequently, the NZ exchange has lost to the ASX on several IPOs, including Straker Translations and Volpara Health Technologies. Straker Translations, the Auckland cloud-based language translation company, listed on the ASX in October last year following the issue of shares to the public at A$1.51 each."

"(Bloomberg) -- Euronext NV cleared another hurdle in its bid to acquire Norways stock exchange after the nations markets regulator said the Franco-Dutch exchange operator and rival bidder Nasdaq Inc. would both make suitable owners. Euronext is now awaiting final approval from Norways finance ministry to complete the $790 million takeover of Oslo Bors VPS Group, the company said in a statement Monday. The suitor has the backing of investors holding 53.2 percent of the shares in Oslo Bors, while Nasdaq has 35 percent. Euronexts public announcement that it had already won the backing of a large pool of investors took the board of Oslo Bors by surprise. The directors went on to invite more potential suitors, prompting U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq to make a counterbid. In a separate statement, Nasdaq also said that the regulator deemed it a fit and proper owner of the Oslo exchange."

"Nasdaq Inc. closed 2.9% lower, while New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc. fell 1.6% and Cboe Global Markets Inc. fell 0.4%. NYSE, Nasdaq and Cboe sued the SEC in a federal appeals court in February to stop the regulator from starting a pilot program where the exchanges test trading fees set lower than current rates. Nasdaq and NYSE are also in a separate court battle with the SEC, after the regulator in October shot down a pair of requests by the exchanges to raise fees for certain market data, saying they hadn't justified the price increases. The SEC's actions threaten a key business of ICE, Nasdaq and Cboe, which together handle around three-fifths of U.S. equities trading volume. Revenue from ICE's and Nasdaq's various data-related businesses rivals what the companies make from trading revenue. A Nasdaq spokesman said: \"We look forward to continuing to work with the commission in the best interests of the markets, investors and our listed companies, but we will oppose them on items that fail this test.\""
"SEC Chairman Jay Clayton The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is starting a broad review of rules that have underpinned trading on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq markets since 2005, according to the agency?s chief. NYSE, Nasdaq and the CBOE Global Markets -- which run the venues where the vast majority of U.S. trading takes place -- have opposed several of the SEC?s market structure plans under Clayton. Clayton says he asked SEC staff to review core market data required to be widely available to traders because of concerns the rules have created a ?two-tiered system? where firms must pay exchanges for private data feeds just to be competitive. Shares of Intercontinental Exchange Inc., NYSE?s parent company, dropped as much as 2.3 percent, Nasdaq Inc. tumbled by 4.4 percent and Cboe Global Markets Inc. fell as much as 3.5 percent. In October SEC said NYSE and Nasdaq had failed to justify increases in fees that are central to their businesses."
"Most exchange operators, including New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, Nasdaq Inc and Cboe Global Markets, have embraced the system in at least some of their exchanges to help boost volumes and fatten their bottom lines. NYSE and Nasdaq declined to comment on the SEC probe into multi-tiered pricing. Cboe said it offers different types of pricing tiers catering to all of its clients and that the tiers are the result of years of intense competition among exchanges. ?At this point, we do not have plans to change our pricing schedules,? ICE, Nasdaq and Cboe have filed lawsuits or appeals challenging the SEC?s authority on those two mandates."

"Norwegian exchange operator Oslo Bors has recommended that its shareholders accept a sweetened buyout offer made by U.S.-based Nasdaq Inc, and reject a bid from Euronext."
"Nasdaq Inc. raised its offer price for Oslo Bors, matching a bid by Euronext NV in the battle to take over the main stock exchange in Scandinavia?s richest economy. The U.S. exchange operator increased its bid by 3.9 percent to 158 kroner a share for Oslo Bors VPS, according to a statement on Monday. Nasdaq also lowered its acceptance condition to at least two-thirds from 90 percent and extended its acceptance period to March 29. Nasdaq Nordic chief executive officer, Lauri Rosendahl, said he?s ?confident? Nasdaq has said its dominant position in the Nordics, where it already runs exchanges in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland, makes it an obvious choice for Norway. It?s already won the support of the Oslo Bors board and the two largest shareholders. In total, Nasdaq is backed by investors owning just over 35 percent of Oslo Bors. The board of Oslo Bors also on Monday reiterated its support for the Nasdaq bid. But Euronext, which already has direct or indirect control of just over 50 percent of Oslo Bors, gave no indication it?s giving up. The Franco-Dutch exchange operator on Monday said it remains confident that it represents the strategically most attractive industrial partner for Oslo Bors and for the Norwegian financial and business community in general."

History Nasdaq was founded in 1971 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FINRA. Beginning in 2000, FINRA restructured and broadened ownership in Nasdaq by selling shares to FINRA members, investment companies and issuers listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. In connection with this restructuring, FINRA fully divested its ownership of Nasdaq in 2006, and The Nasdaq Stock Market became fully operational as an independent registered national securities exchange in 2007. In 2006, Nasdaq also reorganized its operations into a holding company structure. In February 2008, Nasdaq and OMX AB combined their businesses. This transformational combination resulted in the expansion of our business from a U.S.-based exchange operator to a global exchange company offering technology that powers our own exchanges and markets as well as many other marketplaces around the world. In connection with this acquisition, we changed our corporate name to The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. We operated under this name until we rebranded our business as Nasdaq, Inc. Growth Strategy Since our transformative combination with OMX AB in 2008, we have grown our business both organically and through acquisitions that have expanded our operations globally and increasingly diversified our product and service offerings. This evolution was driven by our ability to create opportunities in areas adjacent to our core businesses, many of which are non-transaction based and rooted in innovative technology. To keep pace with our understanding of future trends and to ensure our continued success in the evolving business environment, we have focused on refining our vision, mission and strategy: Our Vision : We reimagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow. Our Mission : We bring together ingenuity, integrity and insights to deliver markets that accelerate economic progress and empower people to achieve their greatest ambitions. Our Strategy : Our strategic direction is driven by our continuous examination of: (i) key macroeconomic, regulatory and technology trends, (ii) consultation with our clients about short- and long-term trends in their businesses and (iii) the competitive landscape. In addition, we are committed to maintaining and enhancing the marketplace platform businesses that are core to Nasdaq, and reducing capital and resources in areas that we believe are not as strategic to our clients and have less growth potential within Nasdaq. ? Increasing Investment in Businesses Where We See the Highest Growth Opportunity . We have increased investment in areas that we believe help solve our clients biggest challenges and are likely to generate growth for our stockholders. In 2018, these businesses included: the data analytics business within our Information Services segment, NPM, within our Corporate Services segment, and our Market Technology segment (including our regulatory technology business). Consistent with this objective, we recently acquired eVestment and Quandl, Inc., which are part of our Information Services segment, and Sybenetix and Cinnober Financial Technology AB, or Cinnober, which are now part of our Market Technology segment. We also are investing further in the Market Technology segment through the Nasdaq Financial Framework, the expansion of our SMARTS products and customers, and our efforts to commercialize disruptive technologies, including blockchain, machine intelligence and the cloud. ? Sustaining Our Foundation. As we strive to grow our business, we also have focused on enhancing our leadership position in the marketplaces in which we operate as we continue to innovate with new functionality and strong market share in our core markets. ? Optimizing Slower Growth Businesses . We continually review areas that are not critical to our core. In these areas, we expect to target resiliency and efficiency versus growth, and free up resources when possible to redirect toward greater opportunities. In furtherance of this strategy, in April 2018 we sold the public relations (Public Relations Solutions) and webcasting and webhosting (Digital Media Services) businesses within our Corporate Solutions business to West Corporation. In addition, in December 2018, we sold our 5.0% ownership interest in LCH.

Each country has one or more national exchanges, which are often the first choice of companies in each respective country. For those considering an alternative, competing European exchanges that frequently attract many listings from outside their respective home countries include LSE, Euronext N.V. In addition to the larger exchanges, companies seeking capital or liquidity from public capital markets are able to raise capital without a regulated market listing and can consider trading their shares on smaller markets and quoting facilities.

The regulatory environment in the other Nordic and Baltic countries in which a Nasdaq entity has a trading venue is broadly similar to the regulatory environment in Sweden.

We operate a licensed exchange, Nasdaq Oslo ASA, in Norway that trades and lists commodity derivatives. Although Norway is not a member of the EU, as a result of the European Economic Area, or EEA, agreement (agreement on the EEA entered into between the EU and European Free Trade Association) the regulatory environment is broadly similar to what applies in EU member states. In addition, in January 2019 new legislation entered into force in Norway mirroring the provisions of MiFID II and MIFIR. As a result, the regulatory environment in Norway is similar to Sweden. The Norwegian FSA supervises the Norwegian exchange on an autonomous basis and the Norwegian exchange has a separate market surveillance function overseen by the Norwegian FSA.. Confidence in capital markets is paramount for trading to function properly. Nasdaq Nordic carries out market surveillance through an independent unit that is separate from the business operations. The surveillance work is conceptually organized into two functions: one for the review and admission of listing applications and surveillance activities related to issuers (issuer surveillance) and one for surveillance of trading (trading surveillance). The real-time trading surveillance for the Finnish, Icelandic, Danish and Swedish markets has been centralized to Stockholm. In addition, there are special personnel who carry out surveillance activities at Nasdaq Oslo and each of the three Baltic exchanges. In Finland and Sweden, decisions to list new companies are made by independent listing committees that have independent members in addition to members from each respective exchange and in the other countries the decision is made by the respective president of the exchange.. Serious breaches are considered by the respective disciplinary committee in Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden. Suspected insider trading is reported to the appropriate authorities in the respective country.. information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is http://www.sec.gov.. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or operating results could be adversely affected.. Economic conditions and market factors, which are beyond our control, may adversely affect our business and financial condition.. Our business performance is impacted by a number of factors, including general economic conditions in both the U.S. and Europe, market volatility, changes in investment patterns and priorities, and other factors that are generally beyond our control. To the extent that global or national economic conditions weaken and result in slower growth or recessions, our business is likely to be negatively impacted. Poor economic conditions may result in a reduction in the demand for our products and services, including our market technology, data, index and corporate solutions, a decline in trading volumes or values and deterioration of the economic welfare of our listed companies. Over 73% of our revenues less transaction-based expenses in 2018 were recurring or subscription-based and if adverse conditions cause our customers to delay or cancel existing orders or subscriptions, our revenues will decline.. Trading volumes and values are driven primarily by general market conditions and declines in trading volumes or values may affect our market share and impact our pricing. our Market Services businesses receive revenues from a relatively small number of customers concentrated in the financial industry, so any event that impacts one or more customers or the financial industry in general could impact our revenues. The number of listings on our markets is primarily influenced by factors such as investor demand, the global economy, available sources of financing, and tax and regulatory policies. Adverse conditions may jeopardize the ability of our listed companies to comply with the continued listing requirements of our exchanges. Information Services revenues may be significantly affected by global economic conditions. Professional subscriptions to our data products are at risk if staff reductions occur in financial services companies, which could result in significant reductions in our professional user revenue. In addition, adverse market conditions may cause reductions in the number of non-professional investors with investments in the market and in ETP assets under management tracking Nasdaq indexes. There may be less demand for our Corporate Solutions or Market Technology products if global economic conditions are weak. Our customers historically cut back on purchases of new services and technology when growth rates decline, thereby reducing our opportunities to sell new products and services or upgrade existing products and services. A reduction in trading volumes or values, market share of trading, the number of our listed companies, or demand for Information Services, Market Technology or Corporate Services products and services due to economic conditions or other market factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The industries we operate in are highly competitive. We face intense competition from other exchanges and markets for market share of trading activity and listings. This competition includes both product and price competition. As a result, both in the U.S. and in other countries, the competition among exchanges and other execution venues has become more intense. Marketplaces in both Europe and the U.S. have also merged to achieve greater economies of scale and scope. The regulatory environment, both in the U.S. and in Europe, is structured to maintain this environment of intense competition. In addition, a high proportion of business in the securities markets is becoming concentrated in a smaller number of institutions and our revenue may therefore become concentrated in a smaller number of customers. We also compete globally with other regulated exchanges and markets, ATSs, MTFs and other traditional and non-traditional execution venues. Some of these competitors also are our customers. Competitors may develop market trading platforms that are more competitive than ours. Competitors may leverage data more effectively or enter into strategic partnerships, mergers or acquisitions that could make their trading, listings, clearing, data or technology businesses more competitive than ours. We face intense price competition in all areas of our business. We have in the past lowered prices, and in the U.S., increased rebates for trade executions to attempt to gain or maintain market share. These strategies have not always been successful and have at times hurt operating performance. Additionally, we have also been, and may once again be, required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by competitors and new entrants, which could adversely impact operating results. We also compete with respect to the pricing of data products and with respect to products for pre-trade book data and for post-trade last sale data. In addition, pricing in our Corporate Services, Index Licensing and Services and Market Technology businesses is subject to competitive pressures. If we are unable to compete successfully in the industries in which we do business, our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected. System limitations or failures could harm our business. Our businesses depend on the integrity and performance of the technology, computer and communications systems supporting them. If new systems fail to operate as intended or our existing systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services. These consequences could result in service outages, lower trading volumes or values, financial losses, decreased customer satisfaction and regulatory sanctions. Our markets and the markets that rely on our technology have experienced systems failures and delays in the past and could experience future systems failures and delays. Although we currently maintain and expect to maintain multiple computer facilities that are designed to provide redundancy and back-up to reduce the risk of system disruptions and have facilities in place that are expected to maintain service during a system disruption, such systems and facilities may prove inadequate. If trading volumes increase unexpectedly or other unanticipated events occur, we may need to expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure. We do not know whether we will be able to accurately project the rate, timing or cost of any volume increases, or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner. While we have programs in place to identify and minimize our exposure to vulnerabilities and work in collaboration with the technology industry to share corrective measures with our business partners, we cannot guarantee that such events will not. our Market Services businesses receive revenues from a relatively small number of customers concentrated in the financial industry, so any event that impacts one or more customers or the financial industry in general could impact our revenues.

Any system issue that causes an interruption in services, decreases the responsiveness of our services or otherwise affects our services could impair our reputation, damage our brand name and negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results. We must continue to introduce new products, initiatives and enhancements to maintain our competitive position. We intend to launch new products and initiatives and continue to explore and pursue opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company. We may spend substantial time and money developing new products, initiatives and enhancements to existing products. If these products and initiatives are not successful, we may not be able to offset their costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In our technology operations, we have invested substantial amounts in the development of system platforms, the rollout of our platforms and the adoption of new technologies, such as blockchain, machine intelligence and the cloud. Although investments are carefully planned, there can be no assurance that the demand for such platforms or technologies will justify the related investments. If we fail to generate adequate revenue from planned system platforms or the adoption of new technologies, or if we fail to do so within the envisioned timeframe, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or enhancements. A decline in trading and clearing volumes or values or market share will decrease our trading and clearing revenues. Trading and clearing volumes and values are directly affected by economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in business and finance, unforeseen market closures or other disruptions in trading, the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, changes in price levels of securities and the overall level of investor confidence. In recent years, trading and clearing volumes and values across our markets have fluctuated significantly depending on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Current initiatives being considered by regulators and governments could have a material adverse effect on overall trading and clearing volumes or values. Because a significant percentage of our revenues is tied directly to the volume or value of securities traded and cleared on our markets, it is likely that a general decline in trading and clearing volumes or values would lower revenues and may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to offset falling volumes or values through pricing changes. Declines in trading and clearing volumes or values may also impact our market share or pricing structures and adversely affect our business and financial condition. If our total market share in securities decreases relative to our competitors, our venues may be viewed as less attractive sources of liquidity. If our exchanges are perceived to be less liquid, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Since some of our exchanges offer clearing services in addition to trading services, a decline in market share of trading could lead to a decline in clearing revenues. Declines in market share also could result in issuers viewing the value of a listing on our exchanges as less attractive, thereby adversely affecting our listing business. Finally, declines in market share of Nasdaq-listed securities could lower The Nasdaq Stock Markets share of tape pool revenues under the consolidated data plans, thereby reducing the revenues of our Data Products business. Our role in the global marketplace may place us at greater risk for a cyberattack. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from security breaches. Some of these threats include attacks from foreign governments, hacktivists, insiders and criminal organizations. Foreign governments may seek to obtain a foothold in U.S. critical infrastructure, hacktivists may seek to deploy denial of service attacks to bring attention to their cause, insiders may pose a risk by human error or malicious activity and criminal organizations may seek to profit from stolen data. Computer viruses and worms also continue to be a threat with ransomware increasingly being used by criminals to extort money. Given our position in the global securities industry, we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of such events. While we continue to employ resources to monitor our systems and protect our infrastructure, these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed. Any system issue, whether as a result of an intentional breach, collateral damage from a new virus or a non-malicious act, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, experience lower trading volumes or values, incur significant liabilities or otherwise have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Any system breach may go undetected for an extended period of time. We also could incur significant expense in addressing any of these problems and in addressing related data security and privacy concerns. The success of our business depends on our ability to keep up with rapid technological and other competitive changes affecting our industry. Specifically, we must complete development of, successfully implement and maintain platforms that have the functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed required by our business and our regulators, as well as by our customers. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, frequent enhancements to existing products and services, the adoption of new services and products and changing customer demands. We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological and other competitive changes affecting our industry. For example, we must continue to enhance our platforms to remain competitive as well as to address our regulatory responsibilities, and our business will be negatively affected if our platforms or the technology solutions we sell to our customers fail to function as expected. If we are unable to develop our platforms to include other.

Further, our failure to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences or any significant delays in product development efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, which may result in an inability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. We must rationalize, coordinate and integrate the operations of our acquired businesses, including Quandl and Cinnober. This process involves complex technological, operational and personnel-related challenges, which are time-consuming and expensive and may disrupt our business. The difficulties, costs and delays that could be encountered may include: ? difficulties, costs or complications in combining the companies operations, including technology platforms, which could lead to us not achieving the synergies we anticipate or customers not renewing their contracts with us as we migrate platforms; ? incompatibility of systems and operating methods; ? reliance on, or provision of, transition services; ? inability to use capital assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined company; ? difficulties of complying with government-imposed regulations in the U.S. and abroad, which may be conflicting; ? resolving possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures; ? the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns and other strategic opportunities; ? difficulties in operating businesses we have not operated before; ? difficulties of integrating multiple acquired businesses simultaneously; ? the retention of key employees and management; ? the implementation of disclosure controls, internal controls and financial reporting systems at non-U.S. subsidiaries to enable us to comply with U.S. securities laws and regulations, including the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, required as a result of our status as a reporting company under the Exchange Act; ? the coordination of geographically separate organizations; ? the coordination and consolidation of ongoing and future research and development efforts; ? possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of a combined company; ? pre-tax restructuring and revenue investment costs; ? the retention of strategic partners and attracting new strategic partners; and ? negative impacts on employee morale and performance as a result of job changes and reassignments. For these reasons, we may not achieve the anticipated financial and strategic benefits from our acquisitions and initiatives. Any actual cost savings and synergies may be lower than we expect and may take a longer time to achieve than we anticipate, and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. We will need to invest in our operations to maintain and grow our business and to integrate acquisitions, and we may need additional funds, which may not be readily available. We depend on the availability of adequate capital to maintain and develop our business. Limited access to capital or credit in the future could have an impact on our ability to refinance debt, maintain our credit rating, meet our regulatory capital requirements, engage in strategic initiatives, make acquisitions or strategic investments in other companies, pay dividends, repurchase our stock or react to changing economic and business conditions. If we are unable to fund our capital or credit requirements, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to our debt obligations, we will need to continue to invest in our operations for the foreseeable future to integrate acquired businesses and to fund new initiatives. If we do not achieve the expected operating results, we will need to reallocate our cash resources. This may include borrowing additional funds to service debt payments, which may impair our ability to make investments in our business or to integrate acquired businesses. Should we need to raise funds through issuing additional equity, our equity holders will suffer dilution. Should we need to raise funds through incurring additional debt, we may become subject to covenants even more restrictive than those contained in our credit facilities, the indentures governing our notes and our other debt instruments. Furthermore, if adverse economic conditions occur, we could experience decreased revenues from our operations which could affect our ability to satisfy financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness. We operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures, fines and enforcement proceedings if we fail to comply with regulatory obligations that can be ambiguous and can change unexpectedly.. products and markets, or if our platforms do not have the required functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed required by our business and our regulators, as well as by our customers, we may not be able to compete successfully.

Further, our failure to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences or any significant delays in product development efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, which may result in an inability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.. We must rationalize, coordinate and integrate the operations of our acquired businesses, including Quandl and Cinnober.

For these reasons, we may not achieve the anticipated financial and strategic benefits from our acquisitions and initiatives. Any actual cost savings and synergies may be lower than we expect and may take a longer time to achieve than we anticipate, and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. We will need to invest in our operations to maintain and grow our business and to integrate acquisitions, and we may need additional funds, which may not be readily available. We depend on the availability of adequate capital to maintain and develop our business. Limited access to capital or credit in the future could have an impact on our ability to refinance debt, maintain our credit rating, meet our regulatory capital requirements, engage in strategic initiatives, make acquisitions or strategic investments in other companies, pay dividends, repurchase our stock or react to changing economic and business conditions. If we are unable to fund our capital or credit requirements, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to our debt obligations, we will need to continue to invest in our operations for the foreseeable future to integrate acquired businesses and to fund new initiatives. If we do not achieve the expected operating results, we will need to reallocate our cash resources. This may include borrowing additional funds to service debt payments, which may impair our ability to make investments in our business or to integrate acquired businesses. Should we need to raise funds through issuing additional equity, our equity holders will suffer dilution. Should we need to raise funds through incurring additional debt, we may become subject to covenants even more restrictive than those contained in our credit facilities, the indentures governing our notes and our other debt instruments. Furthermore, if adverse economic conditions occur, we could experience decreased revenues from our operations which could affect our ability to satisfy financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.

We operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures, fines and enforcement proceedings if we fail to comply with regulatory obligations that can be ambiguous and can change unexpectedly.. We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., Europe and Canada. The securities trading industry is subject to significant regulatory oversight and could be subject to increased governmental and public scrutiny in the future that can change in response to global conditions and events. Our ability to comply with complex and changing regulation is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. While we have policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage our risks and regulatory obligations, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed. Our regulated markets are subject to audits, investigations, administrative proceedings and enforcement actions relating to compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Regulators have broad powers to impose fines, penalties or censure, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit operations, revoke licenses or registrations and impose other sanctions on our exchanges, broker-dealers and markets for violations of applicable requirements. For example, during 2016, the SFSA and the other Nordic financial supervisory authorities conducted investigations of cybersecurity processes at our Nordic exchanges and clearinghouse. In December 2016, we were issued a $6 million fine by the SFSA as a result of findings in connection with its investigation. The SFSAs conclusions related to governance issues rather than systems and platform security. We have appealed this decision and the final outcome is still pending. In the future, we could be subject to regulatory investigations or enforcement proceedings that could result in substantial sanctions, including revocation of our operating licenses. Any such investigations or proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources, including management time, and potential harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our clearinghouse operations expose us to risks, including credit or liquidity risks that may include defaults by clearing members, or insufficiencies in margins or default funds. We are subject to risks relating to our operation of a clearinghouse, including counterparty and liquidity risks, risk of defaults by clearing members and risks associated with adequacy of the customer margin and of default funds. We may be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of a clearing member, which may cause us negative financial impact, reputational harm or regulatory consequences, including litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. In September 2018, a member of the Nasdaq Clearing commodities market defaulted due to an inability to post sufficient collateral to cover increased margin requirements for the positions of the relevant member, which had experienced losses due to sharp adverse movements in the Nordic - German power market spread. Nasdaq Clearing followed default procedures and offset the future market risk on the defaulting members positions. The default resulted in a loss of $133 million which was allocated to Nasdaq Clearing and the members of the commodities default fund in accordance with the liability waterfall. To the extent that our regulatory capital and risk management policies are not adequate to manage future financial and operational risks in our clearinghouse, we may experience adverse consequences to our operating results or ability to conduct our business. We clear or stand as riskless principal to a range of equity-related and fixed-income-related derivative products, commodities and resale and repurchase agreements. We assume the counterparty risk for all transactions that are cleared through our markets and guarantee that our cleared contracts will be honored. No guarantee can be given that the collateral provided will at all times be sufficient. Although we maintain clearing capital resources to serve as an additional layer of protection to help ensure that we are able to meet our obligations, these resources may not be sufficient. In addition, one of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Execution Access, has a clearing arrangement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Financial Services LLC, or ICBC. As of December 31, 2018, we have contributed $15 million of clearing deposits to ICBC in connection with this clearing arrangement. Some of the trading activity in Execution Access is cleared by ICBC through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation.

We also have credit risk related to transaction and subscription-based revenues that are billed to customers on a monthly or quarterly basis, in arrears.. Credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.. The regulatory framework under which we operate and new regulatory requirements or new interpretations of existing regulatory requirements could require substantial time and resources for compliance, which could make it difficult and costly for us to operate our business.. business is subject to regulatory oversight in all the countries in which we operate regulated businesses, such as exchanges, clearinghouses or central securities depositories. In these countries, we have received authorization from the relevant authorities to conduct our regulated business activities. The authorities may revoke this authorization if we do not suitably carry out our regulated business activities. The authorities are also entitled to request that we adopt measures in order to ensure that we continue to fulfill the authorities requirements.. Furthermore certain of our customers operate in a highly regulated industry. Regulatory authorities could impose regulatory changes that could impact the ability of our customers to use our exchanges. The loss of a significant number of customers or a reduction in trading activity on any of our exchanges as a result of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.. Regulatory changes and changes in market structure could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Industry responses to the MiFID II and MiFIR rules, EU Benchmark Regulation or other applicable rules could affect our operations in Europe. Changes to the rules themselves could also affect our operations in Europe. In addition, actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the U.S. and Europe could have a material impact on our business.. Regulatory changes or future court rulings may have an adverse impact on our revenue from proprietary data products.. In Canada, all new marketplace fees and changes to existing fees, including trading and data fees, must be filed with and approved by the Ontario Securities Commission. In 2016, the Canadian Securities Administrators approved amendments adopting a Data Fees Methodology that restricts the total amount of fees that can be charged by all marketplaces to a reference level that is not yet defined. When a reference is established, all marketplaces will be subject to annual reviews of their market data fees tying market data revenues to market share.. Our European exchanges currently offer data products to customers on a non-discriminatory and reasonable commercial basis. The MiFID II/MiFIR rules entail that the price for regulated data such as pre- and post-trade data shall be based on cost plus a reasonable margin. However, what constitutes reasonable margin is not clearly defined. There is a risk that a different interpretation of this term may influence the fees for European data products adversely. In addition, any future actions by the European Commission or European court decisions could affect our ability to offer data products in the same manner as today, thereby causing an adverse effect on our Data Products revenues. Technology issues relating to our role as exclusive processor for Nasdaq-listed stocks could affect our business. Nasdaq, as technology provider to the UTP Operating Committee, implemented in 2016 measures to enhance the resiliency of the existing processor system. Additionally, the UTP Operating Committee approved Nasdaqs proposal to transfer the processor technology from its current enhanced platform to our INET platform. The migration, which was completed in late 2016, further enhanced the resiliency of the processor systems. In 2018, we further improved the systems resiliency by adding the UTP SnapShot service. However if, despite these improvement measures, future outages occur or the processor systems fail to function properly while we are operating the systems, it could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or operating results. Our operational processes are subject to the risk of error, which may result in financial loss or reputational damage. We have instituted extensive controls to reduce the risk of error inherent in our operations; however, such risk cannot completely be eliminated. Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and report, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets. Some of our operations require complex processes, and the introduction of new products or services or changes in processes or reporting due to regulatory requirements may result in an increased risk of errors for a period after implementation. Data, other content or information that we distribute may contain errors or be delayed, causing reputational harm. Even with a favorable outcome, significant litigation against us might unduly burden management, personnel, financial and other resources. In addition, the sophisticated software we sell to our customers may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may be discovered only after delivery. These errors may result in negative customer experiences that could damage our reputation, thereby causing loss of customers, loss of revenues and liability for damages, thereby adversely affecting our business and financial results..

These errors may result in negative customer experiences that could damage our reputation, thereby causing loss of customers, loss of revenues and liability for damages, thereby adversely affecting our business and financial results.. Uncertainty relating to the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union could cause uncertainty and adversely impact our business. We continue to evaluate the potential effect of the United Kingdoms planned departure from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit) on our business operations and financial results. If the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union terminates without an agreement for the United Kingdom's orderly departure from the European Union there could be unfavorable consequences including a deterioration of general economic conditions, increased costs from re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the United Kingdom and European Union, volatility of foreign exchange rates and legal uncertainty. Brexit may also have adverse tax effects on movement of products or activities between the UK and EU. Currently, we do not anticipate that Brexit will have a material impact on our operations or our financial results. While we have operations in the UK, these operations are limited in scope and not material to our overall business. However, we may be impacted if our customers in the UK are subject to additional costs or restrictions in accessing our products or services. In addition, the overall impact of Brexit may create further global economic uncertainty, which may adversely impact the activities of our customers. Laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may affect our services or result in increased costs, legal claims or fines against us. Our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders. Legal and contractual requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve; regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently across jurisdictions and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, extends the scope of the European Union data protection law and requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. In addition to directly applying to certain Nasdaq business activities, this regulation impacts many of our customers, which may affect their requirements and decisions related to services that we offer. Although we have implemented a program to address GDPR requirements, our efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws may entail substantial expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could impact the services that we offer. Furthermore, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. Stagnation or decline in the listings market could have an adverse effect on our revenues. The market for listings is dependent on the prosperity of companies and the availability of risk capital. A stagnation or decline in the number of new listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market and the Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges could cause a decrease in revenues for future years. Furthermore, a prolonged decrease in the number of listings could negatively impact the growth of our transactions revenues. Our Corporate Solutions business is also impacted by declines in the listings market or increases in acquisitions activity as there will be fewer publicly-traded customers that need our products. Our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets. Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term debt and commercial paper are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and corporate development activity, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting our industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Our failure to maintain those ratings could reduce or eliminate our ability to issue commercial paper and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital. A reduction in credit ratings would also result in increases in the cost of our commercial paper and other outstanding debt as the interest rate on the outstanding amounts under our credit facilities and most tranches of our senior notes fluctuates based on our credit ratings. Damage to our reputation or brand name could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. One of our competitive strengths is our strong reputation and brand name. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk, including issues relating to: ? our ability to maintain the security of our data and systems; ? the quality and reliability of our technology platforms and systems; ? the ability to fulfill our regulatory obligations; ? the ability to execute our business plan, key initiatives or new business ventures and the ability to keep up with changing customer demand; ? the representation of our business in the media; ? the accuracy of our financial statements and other financial and statistical information; ? the accuracy of our financial guidance or other information provided to our investors; ? the quality of our corporate governance structure; ? the quality of our products, including the reliability of our transaction-based, Corporate Solutions and Market.

Furthermore, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability..

Furthermore, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.. Stagnation or decline in the listings market could have an adverse effect on our revenues. The market for listings is dependent on the prosperity of companies and the availability of risk capital. A stagnation or decline in the number of new listings on The Nasdaq Stock Market and the Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges could cause a decrease in revenues for future years. Furthermore, a prolonged decrease in the number of listings could negatively impact the growth of our transactions revenues. Our Corporate Solutions business is also impacted by declines in the listings market or increases in acquisitions activity as there will be fewer publicly-traded customers that need our products. Our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets. Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term debt and commercial paper are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and corporate development activity, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting our industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Our failure to maintain those ratings could reduce or eliminate our ability to issue commercial paper and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital. A reduction in credit ratings would also result in increases in the cost of our commercial paper and other outstanding debt as the interest rate on the outstanding amounts under our credit facilities and most tranches of our senior notes fluctuates based on our credit ratings. Damage to our reputation or brand name could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. One of our competitive strengths is our strong reputation and brand name. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk, including issues relating to: ? our ability to maintain the security of our data and systems; ? the quality and reliability of our technology platforms and systems; ? the ability to fulfill our regulatory obligations; ? the ability to execute our business plan, key initiatives or new business ventures and the ability to keep up with changing customer demand; ? the representation of our business in the media; ? the accuracy of our financial statements and other financial and statistical information; ? the accuracy of our financial guidance or other information provided to our investors; ? the quality of our corporate governance structure; ? the quality of our products, including the reliability of our transaction-based, Corporate Solutions and Market.

Damage to our reputation could cause some issuers not to list their securities on our exchanges, as well as reduce the trading volumes or values on our exchanges or cause us to lose customers in our Data Products, Index Licensing and Services, Corporate Solutions or Market Technology businesses. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets in the future. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. As of December 31, 2018, goodwill totaled $6.4 billion and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $2.3 billion . The determination of the value of such goodwill and intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess goodwill and intangible assets, as well as other long-lived assets, including equity and cost method investments and property and equipment, for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. We estimate the fair value of such assets by assessing many factors, including historical performance, capital requirements and projected cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to project future cash flows and evaluate the impact of expected operating and macroeconomic changes on these cash flows. The estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning process. However, there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates. There was no impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, and there were no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in 2018 and 2017. As discussed in Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $578 million in 2016. We may experience future events that may result in asset impairments. Future disruptions to our business, prolonged economic weakness or significant declines in operating results at any of our reporting units or businesses, may result in impairment charges to goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets.

Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading volumes or values. Additionally, since borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates, any increase in interest rates on debt that we have not fixed using interest rate hedges will increase our interest expense, reduce our cash flow or increase the cost of future borrowings or refinancings. Other than variable rate debt, we believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnifies the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results. As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a relatively larger impact on operating results. A substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel costs, regulation and corporate overhead, none of which can be adjusted quickly and some of which cannot be adjusted at all. Our operating expense levels are based on our.

If actual revenue is below managements expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, both revenues less transaction-based expenses and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. Because of these factors, it is possible that our operating results or other operating metrics may fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. If this happens, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected. Our leverage limits our financial flexibility, increases our exposure to weakening economic conditions and may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. Our indebtedness as of December 31, 2018 was $3.8 billion. We may borrow additional amounts by utilizing available liquidity under our existing credit facilities or issuing short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes through our commercial paper program. Our leverage could: ? reduce funds available to us for operations and general corporate purposes or for capital expenditures as a result of the dedication of a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness; ? increase our exposure to a continued downturn in general economic conditions; ? place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors with less debt; ? affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for refinancing indebtedness, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures or other purposes; and ? increase our cost of debt and reduce or eliminate our ability to issue commercial paper. In addition, we must comply with the covenants in our credit facilities. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on assets, dispose of assets and pay dividends (although we are permitted to pay cash dividends on our common stock). Failure to meet any of the covenant terms of our credit facilities could result in an event of default. If an event of default occurs, and we are unable to receive a waiver of default, our lenders may increase our borrowing costs, restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings and accelerate all amounts outstanding. We are subject to litigation risks and other liabilities. Many aspects of our business potentially involve substantial liability risks. Although under current law we are immune from private suits arising from conduct within our regulatory authority and from acts and forbearances incident to the exercise of our regulatory authority, this immunity only covers certain of our activities in the U.S., and we could be exposed to liability under national and local laws, court decisions and rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory agencies. Some of our other liability risks arise under the laws and regulations relating to the tax, employment, intellectual. If actual revenue is below managements expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, both revenues less transaction-based expenses and operating results would be materially and adversely affected.

Some of our other liability risks arise under the laws and regulations relating to the tax, employment, intellectual. property anti-money laundering, technology export, foreign asset controls, foreign corrupt practices areas, employee labor and employment areas, including anti-discrimination and fair-pay laws and regulations.. Liability could also result from disputes over the terms of a trade, claims that a system failure or delay cost a customer money, claims we entered into an unauthorized transaction or claims that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a securities transaction. As we intend to defend any such litigation actively, significant legal expenses could be incurred. Although we carry insurance that may limit our risk of damages in some cases, we still may sustain uncovered losses or losses in excess of available insurance that would affect our financial condition and results of operations.. We have self-regulatory obligations and also operate for-profit businesses, and these two roles may create conflicts of interest.. Our Nordic and Baltic exchanges monitor trading and compliance with listing standards in accordance with the European Unions Market Abuse Regulation and other applicable laws. The prime objective of such monitoring activities is to promote confidence in the exchanges among the general public and to ensure fair and orderly functioning markets. Any failure to diligently and fairly regulate the Nordic and Baltic exchanges could significantly harm our reputation, prompt scrutiny from regulators and adversely affect our business and reputation.. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our brand-building efforts and ability to compete effectively.. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, clients, strategic partners, employees and others. However, the efforts we have. taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights might not be sufficient, or effective, at stopping unauthorized use of those rights. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. We have registered, or applied to register, our trademarks in the United States and in over 50 foreign jurisdictions and have pending U.S. and foreign applications for other trademarks. We also maintain copyright protection on our branded materials and pursue patent protection for software products, inventions and other processes developed by us. We also hold a number of patents, patent applications and licenses in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. However, effective trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection might not be available or cost-effective in every country in which our services and products are offered. patent law may affect our ability to protect and defend our innovations. There is also a risk that the scope of protection under our patents may not be sufficient in some cases, or that existing patents may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our brand and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, defending our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. To the extent that any of our vendors or other third-party service providers experiences difficulties, materially changes their business relationship with us or is unable for any reason to perform their obligations, our business or our reputation may be materially adversely affected. We also rely on members of our trading community to maintain markets and add liquidity. To the extent that any of our largest members experiences difficulties, materially changes its business relationship with us or is unable for any reason to perform market making activities, our business or our reputation may be materially adversely affected. We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations, and any restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As a holding company, we require dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet cash requirements. Minimum capital requirements mandated by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over some of our regulated subsidiaries indirectly restrict the amount of dividends paid upstream. In addition, unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. are used to finance our international operations and are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make other payments to us when needed, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Acquisitions, dispositions, investments, joint ventures and other transactional activities may require significant resources and/or result in significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities. Over the past several years, acquisitions have been significant factors in our growth. We also may divest additional businesses or assets in the future. Although we cannot predict our transactional activities with complete accuracy, we believe that additional acquisitions, divestments, investments, joint ventures and other transactional activities will be important to our strategy. Such transactions may be material in size and scope. Many of the other potential purchasers of assets in our industry have greater financial resources than we have. Therefore, we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete future transactions on terms favorable to us. We also invest in startups through our Nasdaq Venture program and also hold minority interests in other entities. Given the size of these investments, we do not have operational control of these entities and may have limited visibility into risk management practices. Thus, we may be subject to additional capital requirements in certain circumstances and financial and reputational risks if there are operational failures. We may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity and/or debt. The issuance of additional equity in connection with any such transaction could be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders. In addition, announcement or implementation of future transactions by us or others could have a material effect on the price of our common stock. The issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially. Additional debt may reduce our liquidity, curtail our access to financing markets, impact our standing with credit rating agencies and increase the cash flow required for debt service. Any incremental debt incurred to finance a transaction could also place significant constraints on the operation of our business.. taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights might not be sufficient, or effective, at stopping unauthorized use of those rights.

Changes in tax laws, regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Like other corporations, we are subject to taxes at the federal, state and local levels, as well as in non-U.S. Changes in tax laws, regulations or policies could result in us having to pay higher taxes, which would in turn reduce our net income. In addition, some of our subsidiaries are subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or operate. In computing our tax obligation in these jurisdictions, we take various tax positions. We cannot assure you that upon review of these positions the applicable authorities will agree with our positions. A successful challenge by a tax authority could result in additional tax imposed on our subsidiaries. Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified professional personnel.

Political, economic or social events or developments in one or more of our non-U.S. locations could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Some locations, such as Lithuania, India and the Philippines, may increase risk. Some of these economies may be subject to greater political, economic and social uncertainties than countries with more developed institutional structures. Unforeseen or catastrophic events could interrupt our critical business functions. We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, extreme weather, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, human error, theft, sabotage and vandalism. Given our position in the global capital markets, we may be more likely than other companies to be a target for malicious disruption activities. In addition, our U.S. and European business operations are heavily concentrated in the U.S. East Coast, and Stockholm respectively. Any event that impacts either of those geographic areas could potentially affect our ability to operate our businesses. We have disaster recovery and business continuity plans and capabilities for critical systems and business functions to mitigate the risk of an interruption. In April 2018, Nasdaq activated its disaster recovery and business continuity plans when its primary data center site in Vasby, Sweden became unavailable due to an errant fire suppression system. Any interruption in our critical business functions or systems could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. For example, some co-location customers lack adequate disaster recovery solutions to avoid loss of trade flow from a sustained interruption of our critical systems. Because we have operations in numerous countries, we are exposed to currency risk. We have operations in the U.S., the Nordic and Baltic countries, the U.K., Australia and many other foreign countries. We therefore have significant exposure to exchange rate movements between the Euro, Swedish Krona and other foreign currencies towards the U.S. Significant inflation or disproportionate changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic conditions, acts of war or terrorism, changes in governmental monetary or tax policy, changes in local interest rates or other factors. These exchange rate differences will affect the translation of our non-U.S. results of operations and financial condition into U.S. dollars as part of the. Furthermore any future transactions could entail a number of additional risks, including: ? problems with effective integration of operations; ? the inability to maintain key pre-transaction business relationships; ? reliance on, or provision of, transition services; ? increased operating costs; ? the diversion of our management team from other operations; ? problems with regulatory bodies; ? risks associated with divesting employees, customers or vendors when divesting businesses or assets; ? declines in the value of investments; ? exposure to unanticipated liabilities; ? difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; and ? changes in our credit rating and financing costs.

If our risk management methods are not effective, our business, reputation and financial results may be adversely affected. We utilize widely-accepted methods to identify, assess, monitor and manage our risks, including oversight of risk management by Nasdaqs Global Risk Management Committee, which comprises senior executives and has responsibility for regularly reviewing risks and referring significant risks to the board of directors or specific board committees. By definition, some risk management methods require subjective evaluation of dynamic information regarding markets, customers or other matters. That variable information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.

The boards determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant. Based on an evaluation of these factors, the board of directors may determine not to declare future dividends at all or to declare future dividends at a reduced amount. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that we will pay future dividends to our stockholders.. Our organizational documents contain provisions that may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us, such as a tender offer or takeover proposal that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock.

In broad terms, our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets, investor sentiment, government and private sector demands for capital, the regulatory environment for capital markets, changes in technology, and changes in investment patterns and priorities. the challenges created by the automation of market data consumption, including competition and the quickly evolving nature of the market data business;. the demand for information about, or access to, our markets, which is dependent on the products we trade, our importance as a liquidity center, and the quality and pricing of our market data and trade management services;. the demand for ETPs licensed to Nasdaq's indexes, enhanced analytics and other financial products based on our indexes as well as changes to the underlying assets associated with existing licensed financial products;. the acceptance of cloud-based services and advanced analytics by our customers and global regulators;. trading volumes and values in equity derivatives, cash equities and FICC, which are driven primarily by overall macroeconomic conditions;. the number of companies seeking equity financing, which is affected by factors such as investor demand, the global economy, and availability of diverse sources of financing, as well as tax and regulatory policies;. the demand by companies and other organizations for the products sold by our Corporate Solutions business, which is largely driven by the overall state of the economy and the attractiveness of our offerings;. continuing pressure in transaction fee pricing due to intense competition in the U.S. The following chart presents the current consensus forecast for gross domestic product growth: Although employment and wage data in many regions seems robust, indicating that the underlying global economy is still quite strong, leading indicators in many regions are pointing to a slowdown. Global gross domestic product growth forecasts have recently started to slow.

There are a number of significant structural and political issues continuing to impact the global economy. Uncertainty surrounding the impact of China's economy, trade tariffs and Brexit contributed to an increase in market volatility in the last quarter of 2018 and continue to pose a risk to global growth. The business environment that we expect may influence our financial performance in 2019 may be characterized as follows: ? rapidly evolving technology for our businesses and their clients; ? increased demand for applications using emerging technologies and sophisticated analytics by both new entrants and industry incumbents; ? the expansion of the number of industries, and emergence of new industries, seeking to use advanced market technology; ? intense competition among U.S. exchanges and dealer-owned systems for cash equity trading and strong competition between MTFs and exchanges in Europe for cash equity trading; and ? globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors extending the competitive horizon beyond national markets.

Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses, the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods, and the earnings power of Nasdaq. Performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization therefore provide investors with a more useful representation of our businesses ongoing activity in each period.. Merger and strategic initiatives expense: We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed a divestiture and a number of acquisitions in recent years which have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly, we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaqs ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaqs performance between periods.. Clearing Default: For the year ended December 31, 2018 , we recorded $31 million in expense related to the clearing default of a Nasdaq Clearing commodities member that occurred in September 2018.

We have excluded these charges as we believe they are non-recurring, as there has never been a loss due to member default in our clearinghouse, and they should be excluded when evaluating the ongoing operating performance of Nasdaq. Any expenses associated with the enhancement of processes and procedures relating to our clearing business will not be excluded from our GAAP results. Other significant items: We have excluded certain other charges or gains, including certain tax items, that are the result of other non-comparable events to measure operating performance. We believe the exclusion of such amounts allows management and investors to better understand the ongoing financial results of Nasdaq. For the year ended December 31, 2016, other significant items primarily included: ? restructuring charges of $41 million which were associated with our 2015 restructuring plan; ? an asset impairment charge of $578 million related to the full write-off of a trade name from an acquired business;.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk represents the potential for losses that may result from changes in the market value of a financial instrument due to changes in market conditions. As a result of our operating, investing and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are also exposed to credit risk as a result of our normal business activities. We have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors. We identify risk exposures and monitor and manage such risks on a daily basis. We perform sensitivity analyses to determine the effects of market risk exposures. We may use derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to our financial positions or risks that are incurred during the normal course of business. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk We are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financial investments and debt obligations which are discussed below. Financial Investments As of December 31, 2018 , our investment portfolio was primarily comprised of trading securities, mainly highly rated European government debt securities, which pay a fixed rate of interest. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 basis points from levels as of December 31, 2018 , the fair value of this portfolio would have declined by $4 million . Debt Obligations As of December 31, 2018 , substantially all of our debt obligations are fixed-rate obligations. While changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixed-rate obligations, we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of the issuance of our 2019 Notes, borrowings under our 2017 Credit Facility and 2016 Credit Facility, and amounts outstanding from the sale of commercial paper under our commercial paper program, all of which have variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2018 , we had principal amounts outstanding of $500 million on the 2019 Notes, $100 million under the 2016 Credit Facility, and $276 million of commercial paper. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates on our outstanding 2019 Notes, the 2016 Credit Facility and our outstanding commercial paper would increase annual interest expense by approximately $9 million based on borrowings as of December 31, 2018 ..

System trades in cash equities routed to other market centers for members of our cash equity exchanges are routed by Nasdaq Execution Services for clearing to the NSCC. In this function, Nasdaq Execution Services is to be neutral by the end of the trading day, but may be exposed to intraday risk if a trade extends beyond the trading day and into the next day, thereby leaving Nasdaq Execution Services susceptible to counterparty risk in the period between accepting the trade and routing it to the clearinghouse. In this interim period, Nasdaq Execution Services is not novating like a clearing broker but instead is subject to the short-term risk of counterparty failure before the clearinghouse enters the transaction. Once the clearinghouse officially accepts the trade for novation, Nasdaq Execution Services is legally removed from trade execution risk. However, Nasdaq has membership obligations to NSCC independent of Nasdaq Execution Services arrangements. Pursuant to the rules of the NSCC and Nasdaq Execution Services clearing agreement, Nasdaq Execution Services is liable for any losses incurred due to a counterparty or a clearing agents failure to satisfy its contractual obligations, either by making payment or delivering securities. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are subject to these transactions can increase our credit risk. However, we believe that the risk of material loss is limited, as Nasdaq Execution Services customers are not permitted to trade on margin and NSCC rules limit counterparty risk on self-cleared transactions by establishing credit limits and capital deposit requirements for all brokers that clear with NSCC. Historically, Nasdaq Execution Services has never incurred a liability due to a customers failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade. Execution Access is an introducing broker which operates the trading platform for our Fixed Income business to trade in U.S. Execution Access has a clearing arrangement with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Financial Services LLC, or ICBC. As of December 31, 2018 , we have contributed $15 million of clearing deposits to ICBC in connection with this clearing arrangement. These deposits are recorded in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Some of the trading activity in Execution Access is cleared by ICBC through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, with ICBC acting as agent.

We also are exposed to credit risk through our clearing operations with Nasdaq Clearing. Our clearinghouse holds material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the clearinghouse may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated. When the clearinghouse has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearinghouse utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. When funds are not held at a central bank, we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk by ensuring that investments are primarily placed in highly rated government and supranational debt instruments. Liquidity risk is the risk a clearinghouse may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearinghouse monitors liquidity requirements closely and maintains funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearinghouse to such funds and assets.

Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. Our clearinghouse seeks to manage this risk by making short term investments of members' cash deposits. In addition, the clearinghouse investment guidelines allow for direct purchases or repurchase agreements of high quality sovereign debt (for example, European government and U.S. Treasury securities), central bank certificates and supranational debt instruments with short dated maturities. ? Security Issuer Risk. Security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments and collateral under reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign, government agency or supranational debt instruments. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies . Revenue Recognition Corporate Services Revenues Listing Services Revenues Listing services revenues primarily include annual renewal fees and initial listing fees. Annual renewal fees do not require any judgments or assumptions by management as these amounts are recognized ratably over the following 12-month period. However, the initial listing fee is allocated to multiple performance obligations including initial and subsequent listing services and corporate solutions services (when a company qualifies to receive these services under the applicable Nasdaq rule), as well as a customer's material right to renew the option to list on our exchanges. In performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the performance obligations is based on the initial and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the corporate solutions services is based on its market value. All listing fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the listing service. The amount of revenue related to the corporate solutions services performance obligation is recognized ratably over a two -year period, which is based on contract terms, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over six years which is based on our historical listing experience and projected future listing duration. Market Technology Revenues We enter into long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software and provide support and other services to our customers which results in these contracts containing multiple performance obligations. We allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. In instances where standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the standalone selling price predominately through an expected cost plus a margin approach. We generally recognize revenue over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance because our customer controls the asset for which we are creating, our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date. For these services, we recognize revenue over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Accounting for our long-term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for schedule and technical issues, productivity, and the complexity of work performed. When adjustments in estimated total contract costs are required, any changes in the estimated revenues from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the effect of such change. If estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. For further discussion related to recognition of these fees, see Revenue From Contracts with Customers - Listing Services, and Revenue From Contracts with Customers - Market Technology, of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Goodwill and Related Impairment Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of. holding funds with a central bank where possible or investing in highly liquid government or supranational debt instruments serves to reduce liquidity risks. ? Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. Our clearinghouse seeks to manage this risk by making short term investments of members' cash deposits. In addition, the clearinghouse investment guidelines allow for direct purchases or repurchase agreements of high quality sovereign debt (for example, European government and U.S. Treasury securities), central bank certificates and supranational debt instruments with short dated maturities. ? Security Issuer Risk. Security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments and collateral under reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign, government agency or supranational debt instruments. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies . Revenue Recognition Corporate Services Revenues Listing Services Revenues Listing services revenues primarily include annual renewal fees and initial listing fees. Annual renewal fees do not require any judgments or assumptions by management as these amounts are recognized ratably over the following 12-month period. However, the initial listing fee is allocated to multiple performance obligations including initial and subsequent listing services and corporate solutions services (when a company qualifies to receive these services under the applicable Nasdaq rule), as well as a customer's material right to renew the option to list on our exchanges. In performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the performance obligations is based on the initial and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the corporate solutions services is based on its market value.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of. each reporting unit of the acquired company. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amount may be impaired, such as changes in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. For purposes of performing our goodwill impairment test, our five reporting units are the Market Services segment, the two businesses comprising the Corporate Services segment: Corporate Solutions and Listing Services, the Information Services segment, and the Market Technology segment. We test for impairment during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using an October 1 measurement date. When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as the basis to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. In performing a qualitative assessment, we consider the extent to which unfavorable events or circumstances identified, such as changes in economic conditions, industry and market conditions or company specific events, could affect the comparison of the reporting units fair value with its carrying amount. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for a reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the size of the reporting units goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over its carrying amount at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments. The quantitative goodwill impairment test consists of two steps performed at the reporting unit level. ? The first step compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its corresponding carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of discounted cash flow valuation, which incorporates assumptions regarding future growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates, as well as guideline public company valuations, incorporating relevant trading multiples of comparable companies and other factors. The estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for each reporting unit, which are approved by our board of directors. If the reporting units estimated fair value exceeds its estimated carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. ? If the first step results in the carrying amount exceeding the fair value of the reporting unit, then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment that should be recorded, if any. In the second step, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for any difference. In conducting the qualitative assessment, we evaluated the performance of each of these reporting units since the last quantitative test, as well as future financial projections to determine if there were any changes in the key inputs used to determine the fair values of each reporting unit. We also considered the qualitative factors in FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles?Goodwill and Other, as well as other relevant events and circumstances. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, we concluded based on a predominance of positive indicators and the weight of such indicators that the fair values of our reporting units are more likely than not greater than their respective carrying amounts and as a result, quantitative analyses were not needed. No goodwill impairment was recorded in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, the determination of certain valuation inputs is subject to managements judgment. Changes in these inputs could materially affect the results of our impairment review. If our forecasts of cash flows or other key inputs are negatively revised in the future, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit would be adversely impacted, potentially leading to an impairment in the future that could materially affect our operating results. Subsequent to our annual impairment test, no indications of impairment were identified. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Related Impairment Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily exchange and clearing registrations, are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount.

In 2018, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment test for all reporting units, as the excesses of their fair values over their respective carrying amounts at the time of the quantitative test in 2017 were significant. In conducting the qualitative assessment, we evaluated the performance of each of these reporting units since the last quantitative test, as well as future financial projections to determine if there were any changes in the key inputs used to determine the fair values of each reporting unit. We also considered the qualitative factors in FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles?Goodwill and Other, as well as other relevant events and circumstances.

Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily exchange and clearing registrations, are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount. Similar to goodwill impairment testing, we. test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using an October 1 measurement date and may first perform a qualitative assessment, considering similar factors as discussed above in the goodwill impairment discussion, to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform or are required to perform a quantitative assessment, the test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount as of the impairment testing date. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is primarily determined on the basis of estimated discounted value, using the Greenfield Approach for exchange and clearing registrations and licenses and the relief from royalty approach or excess earnings approach for trade names, both of which incorporate assumptions regarding future revenue projections and discount rates. During our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed a qualitative test as the excess fair value of each individual indefinite-lived intangible asset over its respective carrying amount at the time of the quantitative test in 2017 was significant. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, we concluded based on a predominance of positive indicators and the weight of such indicators that the fair values of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are more likely than not greater than their respective carrying amounts and as a result, quantitative analyses were not needed. There were no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in 2018 and 2017. Subsequent to our annual indefinite-lived impairment test, no indications of impairment were identified. In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $578 million to write off the full value of a trade name from an acquired business due to a continued decline in the operating performance of the business during 2016 and a rebranding of our fixed income business under a single brand called Nasdaq Fixed Income. There were no other impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other Long-Lived Assets and Related Impairment We review our other long-lived assets, such as finite-lived intangible assets, equity method investments and equity securities, as well as property and equipment for potential impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Fair value of finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment is based on various valuation techniques. We evaluate our equity method investments and equity securities for other-than-temporary declines in value by considering a variety of factors such as the earnings capacity of the investment and the fair value of the investment compared to its carrying amount. In addition, for investments where the market value is readily determinable, we consider the underlying stock price as an additional factor. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to operating results. In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $7 million to write off the full value of an equity method investment since the fair value of the investment was less than the carrying value and management considered the decline in value to be other-than-temporary. No other impairments of equity method investments or equity securities were recorded in 2018, 2017 or 2016. We recorded pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment asset impairment charges of $9 million in 2017 and $8 million in 2016. There were no other impairments of property and equipment recorded in 2018, 2017 or 2016. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the recognition thresholds, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.. test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using an October 1 measurement date and may first perform a qualitative assessment, considering similar factors as discussed above in the goodwill impairment discussion, to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.

In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $7 million to write off the full value of an equity method investment since the fair value of the investment was less than the carrying value and management considered the decline in value to be other-than-temporary. No other impairments of equity method investments or equity securities were recorded in 2018, 2017 or 2016. We recorded pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment asset impairment charges of $9 million in 2017 and $8 million in 2016. There were no other impairments of property and equipment recorded in 2018, 2017 or 2016. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the recognition thresholds, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.. and the fair value of the investment compared to its carrying amount.

In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in such jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest may be due. While we believe that our tax liabilities reflect the probable outcome of identified tax uncertainties, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may be greater or less than the amount accrued. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result..

There have been no changes in Nasdaqs internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Nasdaqs internal control over financial reporting. Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in the reports that we file with the SEC. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on managements estimates and judgments.. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over Nasdaqs financial reporting. Although there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, we maintain a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition that could have a material effect on the financial statements.. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 framework). This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate..

Actual results could differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency Foreign denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and recorded through the income statement. Translation gains or losses resulting from translating our subsidiaries financial statements from the local functional currency to the reporting currency, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet date while revenues and expenses are translated at the date the transaction occurs or at an applicable average rate. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include all non-restricted cash in banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Such equivalent investments included in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $198 million as of December 31, 2018 and $183 million as of December 31, 2017. Cash equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these investments. Restricted Cash Current restricted cash, which was $41 million as of December 31, 2018 and $22 million as of December 31, 2017, is restricted from withdrawal due to a contractual or regulatory requirement or not available for general use and is classified as restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, current restricted cash primarily includes restricted cash held for our trading and clearing businesses. Receivables, net Our receivables are concentrated with our member firms, market data distributors, listed companies, corporate solutions and market technology customers. Receivables are shown net of a reserve for uncollectible accounts. The reserve for bad debts is maintained at a level that management believes to be sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the accounts receivable portfolio. The reserve is increased by the provision for bad debts which is charged against operating results and decreased by the amount of charge-offs, net of recoveries. In circumstances where a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations is known (i.e., bankruptcy filings), we record a specific provision for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. Accounts receivable are written-off against the reserve for bad debts when collection efforts cease. Due to changing economic, business and market conditions, we review the reserve for bad debts monthly and make changes to the reserve through the provision for bad debts as appropriate. If circumstances change (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customers ability to pay), our estimates of recoverability could be reduced by a material amount. The total reserve netted against receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $13 million as of December 31, 2018, $9 million as of December 31, 2017 and $13 million as of December 31, 2016. The changes in the balance between periods was immaterial. Investments Purchases and sales of investment securities are recognized on settlement date. Financial investments, at fair value Financial investments, at fair value are primarily comprised of highly rated European government debt securities bought principally to meet regulatory capital requirements mainly for our clearing operations at Nasdaq Clearing. These investments are classified as trading securities as they are generally sold in the near term. Changes in fair value of trading securities are included in other investment income. Debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale investment securities are primarily comprised of commercial paper and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses on these securities are included in earnings upon disposition of the securities using the specific identification method. In addition, realized losses are recognized when management determines that a decline in value is other than temporary, which requires judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery. For financial investments that are classified as available-for-sale securities, we also consider the extent to which cost exceeds fair value, the duration of that difference, managements judgment about the issuers current and prospective financial condition, as well as our intent and ability to hold the security until recovery of the unrealized losses. Fair value of both trading and available-for-sale investment securities is generally obtained from third party pricing sources. When available, quoted market prices are used to determine fair value. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using pricing models with observable market inputs. The inputs to the valuation models vary by the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, and prices of similar assets. Pricing models generally do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed use inputs observed from active markets. See Fair Value Measurements, below for further discussion of fair value measures.. financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

See Fair Value Measurements, below for further discussion of fair value measures.. Equity Securities Our investments in equity securities are included in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we intend to hold these investments for more than one year. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01 which requires that investments in equity securities (excluding equity method investments) be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Equity securities are no longer classified as trading or available-for-sale. We elected the measurement alternative for equity securities which were historically accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Since these equity securities do not have readily determinable fair values, they are measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. We assess relevant transactions that occur on or before the balance sheet date to identify observable price changes, and we regularly monitor these investments to evaluate whether there is an indication that the investment is impaired, based on the implied value of recent company financings, public market prices of comparable companies, and general market conditions. If a qualitative assessment indicates that the security is impaired, Nasdaq will estimate the fair value of the security, and if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the security, recognize an impairment loss in net income equal to the difference between the carrying amount and fair value. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of this change. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no impairment charges were recorded on our equity securities and there were no upward or downward adjustments recorded. Equity Method Investments In general, the equity method of accounting is used when we own 20% to 50% of the outstanding voting stock of a company or when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of a company. We have certain investments in which we have determined that we have significant influence and as such account for the investments under the equity method of accounting. We record our pro-rata share of earnings or losses each period and record any dividends as a reduction in the investment balance. We evaluate our equity method investments for other-than-temporary declines in value by considering a variety of factors such as the earnings capacity of the investment and the fair value of the investment compared to its carrying amount. In addition, for investments where the market value is readily determinable, we consider the underlying stock price. If the estimated fair value of the investment is less than the carrying amount and management considers the decline in value to be other than temporary, the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value is recognized in the financial statements as an impairment. In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $7 million to write off the full value of an equity method investment since the fair value of the investment was less than the carrying value and management considered the decline in value to be other-than-temporary. No other impairments of equity method investments were recorded in 2018, 2017 or 2016. Default Funds and Margin Deposits Nasdaq Clearing members cash contributions are included in default funds and margin deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and a current liability. These balances may fluctuate over time due to changes in the amount of deposits required and whether members choose to provide cash or non-cash contributions. Non-cash contributions include highly rated government debt securities that must meet specific criteria approved by Nasdaq Clearing. Non-cash contributions are pledged assets that are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Nasdaq Clearing does not take legal ownership of these assets and the risks and rewards remain with the clearing members. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities Non-Designated Derivatives We use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure of intercompany loans, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other balance sheet items. These contracts are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value amounts of our derivative instruments were immaterial. Net Investment Hedges Net assets of our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We may utilize net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising from re-measuring our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Our 2021 and 2023 Notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. Any increase or decrease related to the remeasurement of the 2021 and 2023 Notes into U.S. dollars is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See 3.875% Senior Unsecured Notes, and 1.75% Senior Unsecured Notes, of Note 9, Debt Obligations, for further discussion. Property and Equipment, net Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized. Equity Securities Our investments in equity securities are included in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we intend to hold these investments for more than one year.

No other impairments of equity method investments were recorded in 2018, 2017 or 2016. Default Funds and Margin Deposits Nasdaq Clearing members cash contributions are included in default funds and margin deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and a current liability. These balances may fluctuate over time due to changes in the amount of deposits required and whether members choose to provide cash or non-cash contributions. Non-cash contributions include highly rated government debt securities that must meet specific criteria approved by Nasdaq Clearing. Non-cash contributions are pledged assets that are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Nasdaq Clearing does not take legal ownership of these assets and the risks and rewards remain with the clearing members.

These contracts are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value amounts of our derivative instruments were immaterial. Net Investment Hedges Net assets of our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We may utilize net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising from re-measuring our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Our 2021 and 2023 Notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. Any increase or decrease related to the remeasurement of the 2021 and 2023 Notes into U.S. dollars is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We develop systems solutions for both internal and external use. Certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software are capitalized. In addition, certain costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as a separate product or as part of a product or process are capitalized beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detailed program design or, in its absence, completion. Prior to reaching technological feasibility, all costs are charged to expense. Unamortized capitalized costs are included in data processing equipment and software, within property and equipment, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally 3 to 5 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the related lease. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using an October 1 measurement date, or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired, such as changes in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. When testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as the basis to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. In performing a qualitative assessment, we consider the extent to which unfavorable events or circumstances identified, such as changes in economic conditions, industry and market conditions or company specific events, could affect the comparison of the reporting units fair value with its carrying amount. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for a reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the size of the reporting units goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting units estimated fair value over its carrying amount at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments. The quantitative goodwill test consists of two steps: ? The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. ? If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the goodwill test is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. An impairment is equal to the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its fair value. We also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using an October 1 measurement date, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount. Such evaluation includes determining the fair value of the asset and comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount . If the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount , an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the difference. For indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then we must perform additional testing of the asset. Otherwise, we conclude that no impairment is indicated and further testing is not performed. There was no impairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and there were no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in 2018 and 2017. In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $578 million to write off the full value of a trade name from an acquired business due to a continued decline in the operating performance of the business during 2016 and a rebranding of our fixed income business under a single brand called Nasdaq Fixed Income. There were no other impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016. Disruptions to our business and events, such as economic weakness or unexpected significant declines in the operating results of any of our reporting units or businesses, may result in goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future. Valuation of Other Long-Lived Assets We review our other long-lived assets, such as finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment, for potential. using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, 2 to 5 years for data processing equipment, and 5 to 10 years for furniture and equipment.

The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Fair value of finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment is based on various valuation techniques. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to operating results. We recorded pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment asset impairment charges of $9 million in 2017 and $8 million in 2016.

Revenue Recognition and Transaction-Based Expenses Revenue From Contracts With Customers On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606 using the full retrospective method. The adoption of Topic 606 impacted the revenue and expense recognition for our Market Technology business and revenue recognition for our Listing Services business. However, the adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption or in any prior reporting periods. There was no impact to revenue and expense recognition for our other businesses. As of January 1, 2016, as a result of the adoption of Topic 606, the impact to retained earnings was immaterial.

Contract Balances Substantially all of our revenues are considered to be revenues from contracts with customers. The related accounts receivable balances are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables which is net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $13 million as of December 31, 2018 and $9 million as of December 31, 2017 . The changes in the balance between periods were immaterial. We do not have obligations for warranties, returns or refunds to customers. For the majority of our contracts with customers, except for our market technology and listings services contracts, our performance obligations are short-term in nature and there is no significant variable consideration. We do not have revenues recognized from performance obligations that were satisfied in prior periods. We have elected not to provide disclosures about transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations if contract durations are less than one year. For contract durations that are one-year or greater, we do not have a material portion of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations that are not included in deferred revenue other than for our market technology contracts which are discussed below under Market Technology. Deferred revenue primarily represents our contract liabilities related to our fees for annual and initial listings, market technology, corporate solutions and information services contracts. Deferred revenue is the only significant contract asset or liability impacted by our adoption of Topic 606. See Revenue Recognition below for further descriptions of our revenue contracts. Sales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit that we have determined to be the contract term or estimated service periods. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. The balance of deferred costs and related amortization expense are not material to our consolidated financial statements. We elected the practical expedient of recognizing sales commissions as an expense when incurred if contract durations are one year or less. We also have elected the practical expedient of excluding sales taxes from transaction prices. Certain judgments and estimates were used in the identification and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and the related allocation of transaction price and are discussed below. We believe that these represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to our customers. Revenue Recognition Our primary revenue contract classifications are described below. Though we discuss additional revenue details in our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the categories below best represent those that depict similar economic characteristics of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows. Market Services Transaction-Based Trading and Clearing Transaction-based trading and clearing includes equity derivative trading and clearing, cash equity trading and FICC revenues. Nasdaq charges transaction fees for trades executed on our exchanges, as well as on orders that are routed to and executed on other market venues. Nasdaq charges clearing fees for contracts cleared with Nasdaq Clearing. In the U.S., transaction fees are based on trading volumes for trades executed on our U.S. exchanges and in Europe, transaction fees are based on the volume and value of traded and cleared contracts. In Canada, transaction fees are based on trading volumes for trades executed on our Canadian exchange. Nasdaq satisfies its performance obligation for trading services upon the execution of a customer trade and clearing services when a contract is cleared, as trading and clearing transactions are substantially complete when they are executed and we have no further obligation to the customer at that time. Transaction-based trading and clearing fees can be variable and are based on trade volume tiered discounts. Transaction revenues, as well as any tiered volume discounts, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules. In the U.S., we also pay liquidity payments to customers based on our published fee schedules. We use these payments to improve the liquidity on our markets and therefore recognize those payments as a cost of revenue. The majority of our FICC trading and clearing customers are charged transaction fees, as discussed above, which are based on the volume and value of traded and cleared contracts. We also enter into annual fixed contracts with customers trading U.S. The customers are charged an annual fixed fee which is billed per the agreement, on a monthly or quarterly basis. These transaction rebates are paid on a monthly basis and the amounts due are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets..

Nasdaq charges clearing fees for contracts cleared with Nasdaq Clearing. In the U.S., transaction fees are based on trading volumes for trades executed on our U.S. exchanges and in Europe, transaction fees are based on the volume and value of traded and cleared contracts. In Canada, transaction fees are based on trading volumes for trades executed on our Canadian exchange. Nasdaq satisfies its performance obligation for trading services upon the execution of a customer trade and clearing services when a contract is cleared, as trading and clearing transactions are substantially complete when they are executed and we have no further obligation to the customer at that time. Transaction-based trading and clearing fees can be variable and are based on trade volume tiered discounts. Transaction revenues, as well as any tiered volume discounts, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules. In the U.S., we also pay liquidity payments to customers based on our published fee schedules. We use these payments to improve the liquidity on our markets and therefore recognize those payments as a cost of revenue. The majority of our FICC trading and clearing customers are charged transaction fees, as discussed above, which are based on the volume and value of traded and cleared contracts. We also enter into annual fixed contracts with customers trading U.S. The customers are charged an annual fixed fee which is billed per the agreement, on a monthly or quarterly basis.

In performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the performance obligations is based on the initial and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the corporate solutions services is based on its market value. All listing fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the listing service. Upon adoption of Topic 606, the amount of revenue related to the corporate solutions services performance obligation is recognized ratably over a two -year period, which is based on contract terms, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over six years which is based on our historical listing experience and projected future listing duration.

Market data products revenues are earned from U.S. and European proprietary market data products. In the U.S., we also earn revenues from U.S. We earn revenues primarily based on the number of data subscribers and distributors of our data. tape plans, revenues are collected monthly based on published fee schedules and distributed quarterly to the U.S. exchanges based on a formula required by Regulation NMS that takes into account both trading and quoting activity. Revenues are presented on a net basis as we are acting as an agent in this arrangement.. The most significant component of market data products revenues recorded on a net basis is the UTP Plan revenue sharing in the U.S. All indicators of principal versus agent reporting under U.S. GAAP have been considered in analyzing the appropriate presentation of the revenue sharing. The exchanges that comprise Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic do not have any market data products revenue sharing agreements.. We develop and license Nasdaq branded indexes, associated derivatives and financial products as part of our Global Index Family. We also provide index data products and custom calculation services for third-party clients. Revenues primarily include license fees from these branded indexes, associated derivatives and financial products in the U.S. We primarily have two types of license agreements: transaction-based licenses and asset-based licenses. Transaction-based licenses are generally renewable agreements. Customers are charged based on transaction volume or a minimum contract amount, or both. If a customer is charged based on transaction volume, we recognize revenue when the transaction occurs. If a customer is charged based on a minimum contract amount, we recognize revenue on a pro-rata basis over the licensing term since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. Asset-based licenses are also generally renewable agreements. Customers are charged based on a percentage of assets under management for licensed products,. per the agreement, on a monthly or quarterly basis. These revenues are recognized over the term of the license agreement since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. Revenue from index data subscriptions are recognized on a monthly basis. Investment Data & Analytics Investment data & analytics revenues are earned from investment content and analytics products. We earn revenues primarily based on the number of content and analytics subscribers and distributors. Subscription agreements are generally annual in term, payable in advance, and provide for automatic renewal. Market Technology Market Technology provides technology solutions for trading, clearing, settlement, surveillance and information dissemination, as well as risk management solutions. Revenues primarily consist of software, license and support revenues, change request and advisory revenues, and software as a service revenues. In our Market Technology business, we enter into long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software, and provide support and other services to our customers. We also enter into agreements to modify the system solutions sold by Nasdaq after delivery has occurred. In addition, we enter into subscription agreements which allow customers to connect to our servers to access our software. Our long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software and provide support and other services to our customers have multiple performance obligations. The performance obligations are generally: 1) software license and installation service and 2) software support. We have determined that the software license and installation service are not distinct as the license and the customized installation service are inputs to produce the combined output, a functional and integrated software system. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. In instances where standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the standalone selling price predominately through an expected cost plus a margin approach. Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for goods and services that are not. per the agreement, on a monthly or quarterly basis. These revenues are recognized over the term of the license agreement since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.

In most instances, contract modifications are for goods and services that are not. distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract. For our long-term contracts, payments are generally made throughout the contract life and can be dependent on either reaching certain milestones or paid upfront in advance of the service period depending on the stage of the contract. For subscription agreements, contract payment terms can be quarterly, annually or monthly, in advance. For all other contracts, payment terms vary. We generally recognize revenue over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance because our customer controls the asset for which we are creating, our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date. For these services, we recognize revenue over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs generally include labor and direct overhead. For software support and update services, and for subscription agreements which allow customers to connect to our servers to access our software, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the service period beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit consistently over the period as Nasdaq provides the services. Accounting for our long-term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for schedule and technical issues, productivity, and the complexity of work performed. When adjustments in estimated total contract costs are required, any changes in the estimated revenues from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the effect of such change. If estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined. Other Revenues Other revenues include the revenues from the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses which were sold in April 2018. Prior to the sale date, these revenues were included in our Corporate Solutions business and were primarily transaction-based revenues.. distinct and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.

As stated above, for contract durations that are one-year or greater, we do not have a material portion of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations that are not included in deferred revenue other than for our market technology contracts. Market technology deferred revenue, as discussed in Note 8, Deferred Revenue, to the consolidated financial statements, represents consideration received that is yet to be recognized as revenue for unsatisfied performance obligations..

Substantially all revenues from the Corporate Services, Information Services and Market Technology segments were recognized over time for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016.. Earnings Per Share We present both basic and diluted earnings per share. Common share equivalents are excluded from the computation in periods for which they have an anti-dilutive effect. Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period are anti-dilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation. PSUs, which are considered contingently issuable, are included in the computation of dilutive earnings per share on a weighted average basis when management determines the related performance criteria are met. Pension and Post-Retirement Benefits Pension and other post-retirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is developed using actuarial valuations. We assess our pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including evaluation of the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rate, healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age assumption, our historical assumptions compared with actual results and analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations. Discount rates used for pension and other post-retirement benefit plan calculations are evaluated annually and modified to reflect the prevailing market rates at the measurement date of a high-quality fixed-income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligations as they come due. Actuarial assumptions are based upon managements best estimates and judgment. The expected rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. pension plans represents our long-term assessment of return expectations which may change based on significant shifts in economic and financial market conditions. The long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived from return assumptions based on targeted allocations for various asset classes. While we consider the pension plans recent performance and other economic growth and inflation factors, which are supported by long-term historical data, the return expectations for the targeted asset categories represent a long-term prospective return. Share-Based Compensation Nasdaq uses the fair value method of accounting for share-based awards. Share-based awards, or equity awards, include stock options, restricted stock, and PSUs. The fair value of stock options are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock awards and PSUs, other than PSUs granted with market conditions, is determined based on the grant date closing stock price less the present value of future cash dividends. We estimate the fair value of PSUs granted with market conditions using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of grant. We generally recognize compensation expense for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, taking into account an estimated forfeiture rate. Granted but unvested shares are generally forfeited upon termination of employment. Nasdaq also has an ESPP that allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of our common stock at six-month intervals, called offering periods, at 85.0% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each offering period. Merger and Strategic Initiatives We incur incremental direct merger and strategic initiative costs relating to various completed and potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. These costs include outside advisor fees, deal-related bonuses to certain employees, and other external costs directly related to proposed or closed transactions. We also incur integration costs primarily related to employee termination costs, deal-related bonuses and professional services costs incurred relating to the integrations. As of December 31, 2018, all planned integrations for our 2017 and 2016 acquisitions have been completed. For the years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we also incurred costs related to the divestiture of our Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses which primarily included outside advisor fees as well as certain employee termination and lease reserves..

Leases We expense rent from non-cancellable operating leases, net of sublease income, on a straight line basis, based on future minimum lease payments. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. We adopted this new guidance on January 1, 2019. See Leases, of Recent Accounting Pronouncements, below for further discussion. Fair value measurement establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect Nasdaqs market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: ? Level 1-Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. ? Level 2-Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. ? Level 3-Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. Tax Matters We use the asset and liability method to determine income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets (net of valuation allowances) and deferred tax liabilities are presented net by jurisdiction as either a non-current asset or liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities (i.e., temporary differences) and are measured at the enacted rates that will be in effect when these differences are realized. If necessary, a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order to recognize and measure our unrecognized tax benefits, management determines whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the recognition thresholds, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in income tax expense. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we finalized the accounting associated with the December 22, 2017 enactment of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Assets Held for Sale We classify assets or disposal groups as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: ? management commits to a plan to sell; ? the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets or disposal groups; ? an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; ? the sale is probable within one year; ? the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and ? it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized until the date of sale. The fair value of an asset less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale, and any change in fair value is reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset, except that increases in fair value are limited to prior decreases recorded. Assets are not depreciated or amortized while they are classified as held for sale. Leases We expense rent from non-cancellable operating leases, net of sublease income, on a straight line basis, based on future minimum lease payments. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. We adopted this new guidance on January 1, 2019. See Leases, of Recent Accounting Pronouncements, below for further discussion. Fair value measurement establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect Nasdaqs market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: ? Level 1-Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. ? Level 2-Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. ?

Accounting Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Customers Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. This ASU clarifies the accounting for implementation costs of a hosting arrangement and aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). Payments for capitalized implementation costs should be classified in the statement of cash flows in the same manner as payments made for fees associated with the hosting element. Capitalized implementation costs should be presented in the balance sheet in the same line item as a prepayment for the fees of the associated hosting arrangement. January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this standard as of July 1, 2018. There was no impact to the financial statements as a result of the adoption of this standard, as we are currently accounting for costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement in accordance with the standard. Fair Value Measurements In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Disclosure Framework?Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. This ASU modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements by removing certain disclosure requirements related to the fair value hierarchy, modifying existing disclosure requirements related to measurement uncertainty, and adding new requirements, mainly for Level 3 fair value measurements. January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this standard as of July 1, 2018 on a prospective basis. There was no impact to the financial statements or our disclosures as a result of the adoption of this standard..

Accounting Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Topic 220). This ASU was issued to address the income tax accounting treatment of the stranded tax effects within other comprehensive income due to the prohibition of backward tracing due to an income tax rate change that was initially recorded in other comprehensive income. This issue came about from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that changed our income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The ASU changed current accounting whereby an entity may elect to reclassify the stranded tax effect from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted this standard as of January 1, 2018. As a result of the adoption of this standard, we recorded a reclassification of $417 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings within stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, of Note 17, Income Taxes, for further discussion. Goodwill In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment and removes the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Goodwill impairment will now be measured using the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the reporting unit and the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not anticipate a material impact on our consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption of this new standard as the carrying amounts of our reporting units have been less than their corresponding fair values in recent years. However, changes in future projections, market conditions and other factors may cause a change in the excess of fair value of our reporting units over their corresponding carrying amounts. We do not anticipate early adoption of this standard.. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)..

Accounting Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters Financial Instruments - Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU changes the impairment model for certain financial instruments. The new model is a forward looking expected loss model and will apply to financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, loan commitments, financial guarantees and net investments in leases, as well as trade receivables. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, credit losses will be measured in a manner similar to today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2019. We will adopt this standard on January 1, 2020. We are currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. Under this ASU, at the commencement date, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessees right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. This guidance is not applicable for leases with a term of 12 months or less. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. The guidance also requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.

Leases We adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of a right-of-use asset of $442 million , a lease liability of $483 million , as well as the elimination of deferred rent and sublease reserves of $41 million as of January 1, 2019. The standard did not impact our statements of income and had no impact on our cash flows. Our implementation of this guidance is subject to the same internal controls over financial reporting that we apply to our consolidated financial statements. Practical Expedients and Accounting Policy Elections We elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the standard to not reassess contracts to determine if they contain leases, lease classification and initial direct costs. We also elected the optional transition method to initially apply the standard at the January 1, 2019 adoption date. As a result, we applied the new lease standard prospectively to leases existing or commencing on or after January 1, 2019. Comparative periods presented will not be restated upon adoption. Similarly, new disclosures under the standard will be made for periods beginning January 1, 2019, and not for prior comparative periods. Prior periods will continue to be reported under guidance in effect prior to January 1, 2019. We made an accounting policy election to treat the lease and non-lease components in a contract as a single performance obligation to the extent that the timing and pattern of transfer are similar for the lease and non-lease components and the lease component qualifies as an operating lease. We also made an accounting policy election not to recognize lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for leases with a term of 12 months or less. We will recognize these lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We did not elect the practical expedient related to using hindsight to reevaluate the lease term. Additionally, since our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on i. Leases We adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019.

The exchange registrations represent licenses that provide ISE with the ability to operate its options exchanges. Nasdaq views these intangible assets as a perpetual license to operate the exchanges so long as ISE meets its regulatory requirements. Nasdaq selected a variation of the income approach called the Greenfield Approach to value the exchange registrations. The Greenfield Approach refers to a discounted cash flow analysis that assumes the buyer is building the exchange from a start-up business to a normalized level of operations as of the acquisition date. This discounted cash flow model considers the required resources and eventual returns from the build-out of operational exchanges and the acquisition of customers, once the exchange registrations are obtained. The advantage of this approach is that it reflects the actual expectations that will arise from an investment in the registrations and it directly values the registrations. The Greenfield Approach relies on assumptions regarding projected revenues, margins, capital expenditures, depreciation, and working capital during the 2 year pre-trade phase, the 10 year ramp-up period, as well as the terminal period. In developing a discount rate for the exchange registrations, we estimated a weighted-average cost of capital for the overall business and we employed this rate when discounting the cash flows. The resulting discounted cash flows were then tax-effected at the applicable statutory rate.

Trade Names As part of our acquisitions of eVestment and ISE, we acquired trade names. These trade names are recognized in the industry and carry a reputation for quality. As such, the reputation and positive recognition embodied in these trade names are a valuable asset to Nasdaq. Methodology The eVestment and ISE trade names were valued using the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method, or RFRM. The RFRM is used to es timate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset who would otherwise have to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. The royalty rate is applied to the projected revenue over the expected remaining life of the intangible asset to estimate royalty savings. The net after-tax royalty savings are calculated for each year in the remaining economic life of the trade name and discounted to present value. Discount Rate The discount rates used reflect the amount of risk associated with the hypothetical cash flows for each trade name relative to the overall business as discussed above in Customer Relationships. Estimated Useful Life We have estimated the useful life of the eVestment trade name to be 8 years and the estimated useful life of the ISE trade name to be indefinite based on the number of years the name has been in service, its popularity within the industry, and our intention to continue to use it in the branding of products.

We determined that we met all of the criteria to classify the assets and liabilities of BWise as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. The disposal of BWise did not represent a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is, therefore, not classified as discontinued operations. No impairment charge was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 as the carrying amount of the net assets was less than the fair value less costs to sell. Fair value was determined based upon the anticipated sales price of these products and services based on current market conditions and. assumptions made by management, which may differ from actual results and may result in an impairment if market conditions deteriorate. In February 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell BWise. Based on the sales price in the agreement, no impairment charge was recorded. See Agreement to Sell BWise, of Note 21, Subsequent Events, for further discussion. 2017 Assets and Liabilities Held For Sale As of December 31, 2017, the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses were classified as held for sale. The disposal of these businesses did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results and were, therefore, not classified as discontinued operations. In April 2018, we sold these businesses. See 2018 Divestiture, of Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestiture, for further discussion. Based on the sales price in the agreement, no impairment charge was recorded at the time of the sale as the carrying amount of the net assets was less than the sales price in the agreement less costs to sell. Major Classes of Assets and Liabilities Held For Sale The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 (in millions) Receivables, net $ 13 $ 27 Property and equipment, net 10 21 Goodwill (1) 47 202 Intangible assets, net (2) 16 38 Other assets 3 9 Total assets held for sale (3) $ 89 $ 297 Deferred tax liabilities $ 4 $ 16 Deferred revenue 12 2 Other current liabilities 4 27 Total liabilities held for sale (4) $ 20 $ 45 ____________ (1) The assignment of goodwill was based on the relative fair value of the disposal group and the portion of the remaining reporting unit.

The decrease in the gross amount and accumulated amortization for customer relationships as of December 31, 2018 compared with 2017 is primarily due to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in fourth quarter of 2018.. As a result of our decision to sell BWise, we reclassified certain intangibles assets to held for sale.

In addition, in April 2018, in connection with the sale of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses, we recorded a $2 million pre-tax, non-cash write-off related to an indefinite-lived intangible asset trade name. Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets was $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , $92 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , and $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Amortization expense increased in 2018 and 2017 primarily due to additional amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets in 2017. The estimated future amortization expense (excluding the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments of $85 million as of December 31, 2018 ) of acquired finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2018 is as follows: (in millions) 2019 $ 100 2020 98 2021 97 2022 94 2023 92 2024 and thereafter 649 Total $ 1,130 6.

In addition, in April 2018, in connection with the sale of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses, we recorded a $2 million pre-tax, non-cash write-off related to an indefinite-lived intangible asset trade name.. Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets was $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , $92 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , and $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Amortization expense increased in 2018 and 2017 primarily due to additional amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets in 2017.

Trading securities, which are included in financial investments, at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are primarily comprised of highly rated European government debt securities, of which $166 million as of December 31, 2018 and $160 million as of December 31, 2017 , are assets primarily utilized to meet regulatory capital requirements, mainly for our clearing operations at Nasdaq Clearing.. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, available-for-sale investment securities, which are included in financial. investments at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were primarily comprised of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the cumulative unrealized gains and losses on these securities were immaterial.. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 , our equity method investments primarily included equity interests in OCC and EuroCCP N.V.. The carrying amounts of our equity method investments are included in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.. Net income recognized from our equity interest in the earnings and losses of these equity method investments was $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 , and $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with the same period in 2017 is primarily due to an increase in income recognized from our investments in OCC and EuroCCP N.V. In March 2015, OCC implemented a capital plan under which the options exchanges that are OCCs stockholders contributed $150 million of new equity capital to OCC, committed to make future replenishment capital contributions under certain circumstances, and received commitments regarding future dividend payments and related matters. See Other Commitments, of Note 19, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, for further discussion of our commitment to make future replenishment capital contributions. Nasdaq PHLX and ISE each contributed $30 million of new equity capital under the OCC capital plan. OCC adopted specific policies with respect to fees, customer refunds and stockholder dividends, which envision an annual dividend equal to the portion of OCCs after-tax income that exceeds OCCs capital requirements after payment of refunds to OCCs clearing members (such refunds are generally 50% of the portion of OCCs pre-tax income that exceeds OCCs capital requirements). In 2018, 2017 and 2016, OCC disbursed annual dividends under the capital plan and Nasdaq, via its ownership interests, as the owner of two shares, received $13 million in 2018, $10 million in 2017 and $4 million in 2016.. The carrying amounts of our equity securities are included in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018 , our equity securities primarily represent various strategic investments made through our corporate venture program. As of December 31, 2017, our equity securities primarily represented our 5.0% ownership in Borsa Istanbul and our 5.0% ownership interest in LCH.. In December 2018, we sold our 5.0% ownership interest in LCH for $169 million in cash. As a result of the sale, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $118 million ( $93 million after tax). The Borsa Istanbul shares, which were issued to us in the first quarter of 2014, were part of the consideration received under a market technology agreement. This investment had a carrying amount of $75 million which was guaranteed to us via a put option negotiated as part of the market technology agreement. During the second quarter of 2018, we exercised the put option and we expect to receive cash consideration in installments through 2022 . In 2018, we received $45 million in cash. The remaining receivable is recorded in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to additional expense associated with assets and software placed in service. There were no impairments of property and equipment recorded in 2018. In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment asset impairment charge of $9 million primarily related to the write-off of capitalized software and hardware equipment associated with our 2017 and 2016 acquisitions. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not own any real estate properties..

See 2018 Divestiture, of Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestiture, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.. The balance as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 primarily includes deferred revenue from listing of additional shares fees which are included in our Listing Services segment. The activity during the period primarily pertains to our Trade Management Services and FICC businesses, which are included in our Market Services segment, for contracts paid monthly or quarterly in advance of the service.. On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606. As a result, a portion of revenues that were previously deferred were recognized either in prior period revenues, through restatement, or as an adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption of the new standard. See Revenue From Contracts With Customers, of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a description of our initial listing, annual listing, market technology, corporate solutions, and information services revenues and the revenue recognition policy for each of these revenue streams.. Other primarily includes revenues from listing of additional shares fees which are included in our Listing Services business.. The timing of recognition of our deferred market technology revenues is primarily dependent upon the completion of customization and any significant modifications made pursuant to existing market technology contracts.

Senior Unsecured Notes Our senior unsecured notes were all issued at a discount. As a result of the discount, the proceeds received from each issuance were less than the aggregate principal amount. Our senior unsecured notes are general unsecured obligations of ours and rank equally with all of our existing and future unsubordinated obligations and they are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. The senior unsecured notes were issued under indentures that, among other things, limit our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, create liens, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions.

Restricted Stock We grant restricted stock to most active employees. The grant date fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing stock price at the date of grant less the present value of future cash dividends. Restricted stock awards granted generally vest 25.0% on the second anniversary of the grant date, 25.0% on the third anniversary of the grant date, and 50.0% on the fourth anniversary of the grant date. PSUs PSUs are based on performance measures that impact the amount of shares that each recipient will receive upon vesting. We have two performance-based long-term PSU programs for certain officers, a one -year performance-based program and a three -year cumulative performance-based program that focuses on TSR. One -Year PSU Program The grant date fair value of PSUs under the one -year performance-based program is based on the closing stock price at the date of grant less the present value of future cash dividends. Under this program, an eligible employee receives a target grant of PSUs, but may receive from 0.0% to 150.0% of the target amount granted, depending on the achievement of performance measures. These awards vest ratably on an annual basis over a three -year period commencing with the end of the one -year performance period. Compensation cost is recognized over the performance period and the three -year vesting period based on the probability that such performance measures will be achieved, taking into account an estimated forfeiture rate. During 2018, certain grants of PSUs with a one -year performance period exceeded the applicable performance parameters. As a result, an additional 51,914 units above target were considered granted in the first quarter of 2019. Three -Year PSU Program Under the three -year performance-based program, each eligible individual receives PSUs, subject to market conditions, with a three -year cumulative performance period that vest at the end of the performance period. Compensation cost is recognized over the three -year vesting period, taking into account an estimated forfeiture rate, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service period has been completed. Performance will be determined by comparing Nasdaqs TSR to two peer groups, each weighted 50.0% . The first peer group consists of exchange companies, and the second peer group consists of all companies in the S&P 500. Nasdaqs relative performance ranking against each of these groups will determine the final number of shares delivered to each individual under the program. The payout under this program will be between 0.0% and 200.0% of the number of PSUs granted and will be determined by Nasdaqs overall performance against both peer groups. However, if Nasdaqs TSR is negative for the three -year performance period, regardless of TSR ranking, the payout will not exceed 100.0% of the number of PSUs granted. We estimate the fair value of PSUs granted under the three -year PSU program using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as these awards contain a market condition. Certain grants of PSUs that were issued in 2016 with a three -year performance period exceeded the applicable performance parameters. As a result, an additional 99,622 units above target were considered granted in the first quarter of 2019. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the weighted-average fair values of the PSU awards granted under the three -year PSU program: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Weighted-average risk free interest rate (1) 2.36 % 1.44 % Expected volatility (2) 18.7 % 19.2 % Weighted-average grant date share price $86.24 $69.45 Weighted-average fair value at grant date $116.86 $81.57 ____________ (1) The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. (2) We use historic volatility for PSU awards issued under the three -year PSU program, as implied volatility data could. Restricted Stock We grant restricted stock to most active employees.

Performance will be determined by comparing Nasdaqs TSR to two peer groups, each weighted 50.0% . The first peer group consists of exchange companies, and the second peer group consists of all companies in the S&P 500. Nasdaqs relative performance ranking against each of these groups will determine the final number of shares delivered to each individual under the program. The payout under this program will be between 0.0% and 200.0% of the number of PSUs granted and will be determined by Nasdaqs overall performance against both peer groups. However, if Nasdaqs TSR is negative for the three -year performance period, regardless of TSR ranking, the payout will not exceed 100.0% of the number of PSUs granted. We estimate the fair value of PSUs granted under the three -year PSU program using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as these awards contain a market condition. Certain grants of PSUs that were issued in 2016 with a three -year performance period exceeded the applicable performance parameters. As a result, an additional 99,622 units above target were considered granted in the first quarter of 2019. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the weighted-average fair values of the PSU awards granted under the three -year PSU program: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Weighted-average risk free interest rate (1) 2.36 % 1.44 % Expected volatility (2) 18.7 % 19.2 % Weighted-average grant date share price $86.24 $69.45 Weighted-average fair value at grant date $116.86 $81.57 ____________ (1) The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. (2) We use historic volatility for PSU awards issued under the three -year PSU program, as implied volatility data could. Compensation cost is recognized over the performance period and the three -year vesting period based on the probability that such performance measures will be achieved, taking into account an estimated forfeiture rate.. During 2018, certain grants of PSUs with a one -year performance period exceeded the applicable performance parameters. As a result, an additional 51,914 units above target were considered granted in the first quarter of 2019.. Under the three -year performance-based program, each eligible individual receives PSUs, subject to market conditions, with a three -year cumulative performance period that vest at the end of the performance period.

We use historic volatility for PSU awards issued under the three -year PSU program, as implied volatility data could. not be obtained for all the companies in the peer groups used for relative performance measurement within the program. In addition, the annual dividend assumption utilized in the Monte Carlo simulation model is based on Nasdaqs dividend yield at the date of grant. As of December 31, 2018 , $14 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the one -year PSU program is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years . For the three -year PSU program, $28 million of total unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years . Stock Options In January 2017, our CEO received 268,817 performance-based non-qualified stock options which will vest annually over a three -year period, with each vesting contingent upon the achievement of annual performance parameters. On January 29, 2019, Nasdaq's management compensation committee and board of directors determined that the performance goal for 2018 was met, resulting in the settlement of the second one-third of the grant. There were no stock option awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016. The weighted-average grant date fair value was $66.68 . We estimated the fair value of this stock option award using the Black-Scholes valuation model using the following assumptions: Expected life (in years) 6 Weighted-average risk free interest rate 2.1 % Expected volatility 25.6 % Dividend yield 1.92 % Our computation of expected life was based on an estimate of the average length of time between option grant and exercise. The interest rate for periods within the expected life of the award was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Our computation of expected volatility was an estimate of the future upward/downward fluctuations in the underlying share price. We used Nasdaq's historical volatility for the trailing 6 -year period as of the grant date. Our computation of dividend yield was based on annualized dividends expressed as a percentage of share price.

Nasdaq Commodities Clearing Default In September 2018, a member of the Nasdaq Clearing commodities market defaulted due to inability to post sufficient collateral to cover increased margin requirements for the positions of the relevant member, which had experienced losses due to sharp adverse movements in the Nordic - German power market spread. Nasdaq Clearing followed default procedures and offset the future market risk on the defaulting members positions. The default resulted in a loss of $133 million which was allocated to Nasdaq Clearing and the members of the commodities default fund in accordance with the liability waterfall as follows: ? the first $8 million of the loss was allocated to Nasdaq Clearings junior capital; and ? the remainder was allocated on a pro-rata basis to the commodities clearing members default funds. During September 2018, Nasdaq Clearing replenished the utilized junior capital of $8 million for the commodities market and the commodities clearing members replenished their pro rata portions of the default fund. Nasdaq Clearing has also increased its junior capital by $14 million for the commodity market. In November 2018, the defaulting member entered into an agreement for a consensual arrangement with creditors, including Nasdaq Clearing, for the recovery of the members default fund losses. In order to reduce the risk profile of commodities clearing operations, Nasdaq Clearing has increased margin levels by increasing the confidence level on commodity products and thereby shifted the risk from waterfall resources more to each portfolio holder's collateral. In addition, Nasdaq Clearing has launched a risk management enhancement program entailing a range of risk mitigating actions, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018 and will continue during 2019. In December 2018, we recorded a $23 million charge associated with the clearing default as a result of our initiating a capital relief program. The capital relief program is in addition to any funds to be recovered from the defaulting member . As a result of the default, a $112 million liability was recorded in other current liabilities and $112 million of collateral was recorded in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 in order to allow Nasdaq Clearing to fulfill the settlement of certain contracts of the defaulted member arising from the default management process. We have established mitigating positions. The collateral and liability were previously included in Default Funds and Margin Deposits.

The carrying value of these securities approximates their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments and reverse repurchase agreements. The remainder of this balance was held in cash in demand deposit accounts at central banks and large, highly rated financial institutions. Of the total default fund contributions of $499 million , Nasdaq Clearing can utilize $436 million as capital resources in the event of a counterparty default. The remaining balance of $63 million pertains to member posted surplus balances. In the investment activity related to default fund and margin contributions, we are exposed to counterparty risk related to reverse repurchase agreement transactions, which reflect the risk that the counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to Nasdaq Clearing. The value of the underlying security is monitored during the lifetime of the contract and in the event the market value of the underlying security falls below the reverse repurchase amount our clearinghouse may require additional collateral or a reset of the contract.

If a default occurs and the defaulting clearing members collateral, including cash. deposits and pledged assets, is depleted, then capital is utilized in the following amount and order: ? junior capital contributed by Nasdaq Clearing, which totaled $31 million as of December 31, 2018 ; ? a loss sharing pool related only to the financial market that is contributed to by clearing members and only applies if the defaulting members portfolio includes interest rate swap products; ? specific market default fund where the loss occurred (i.e., the financial, commodities, or seafood market), which includes capital contributions of the clearing members on a pro-rata basis; ? senior capital contributed to each specific market by Nasdaq Clearing, calculated in accordance with clearinghouse rules, which totaled $23 million as of December 31, 2018 ; and ? mutualized default fund, which includes capital contributions of the clearing members on a pro-rata basis. If additional funds are needed after utilization of the liability waterfall, then Nasdaq Clearing will utilize its power of assessment and additional capital contributions will be required by non-defaulting members up to the limits established under the terms of the clearinghouse rules. In addition to the capital held to withstand counterparty defaults described above, Nasdaq Clearing also has committed capital of $67 million to ensure that it can handle an orderly wind-down of its operation, and that it is adequately protected against investment, operational, legal, and business risks.

A reconciliation of the income tax provision, based on the U.S. federal statutory rate, to our actual income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Federal income tax provision at the statutory rate 21.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax provision, net of federal effect 3.7 % 2.6 % (6.7 )% Change in deferred taxes due to change in law 27.0 % (9.9 )% (1.2 )% Excess tax benefits related to employee share-based compensation (0.7 )% (4.0 )% ? % Non-U.S. subsidiary earnings 0.1 % (6.0 )% (7.3 )% Tax credits and deductions (0.2 )% (1.0 )% (5.1 )% Change in unrecognized tax benefits 4.7 % (0.8 )% 4.2 % Other, net 1.4 % 0.5 % 1.4 % Actual income tax provision 57.0 % 16.4 % 20.3 % The majority of the increase in our effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 and the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was the result of the final and provisional impacts from The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017.

Also impacting the increase in the effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was the reversal of certain Swedish tax benefits recorded in prior periods and the tax expense associated with the sale of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses. We recorded income tax benefits of $9 million in 2018, $40 million in 2017 and $41 million in 2016, primarily related to share-based compensation. In 2018 and 2017, the benefit was included in income tax expense and in 2016, the benefit was recorded as additional paid-in-capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the adoption of accounting guidance on January 1, 2017. This guidance requires all income tax effects of share-based awards to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled on a prospective basis, as opposed to stockholders equity. We are subject to examination by federal, state and local, and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by each jurisdiction and have established tax reserves that we believe are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments.

Although we continue to assert the validity of these interest expense deductions, the decisions of the court lead us to conclude that we can no longer assert that we are more than likely to be successful in our appeal. As such, in 2018, we recorded tax expense of $41 million , or $0.24 per diluted share, which is net of any related U.S. tax benefits and reflects the impact of foreign currency translation. We expect to record future quarterly net tax expense of $1 million related to this matter. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contained several key provisions, including a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. It also imposed a transition tax on unremitted aggregate accumulated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which did not impact us and the act also created a new requirement to provide U.S. tax on foreign earnings, global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, which was immaterial for 2018. To the extent that we incur future expense under the GILTI provisions, we will record the expense as a component of income tax expense as a current-period expense when incurred. We were required to remeasure all of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 22, 2017 and record the impact of such remeasurement in our 2017 financial statements. The net effect of applying the provisions of the act on our 2017 Consolidated Statement of Income was a non-cash provisional tax benefit of $89 million , substantially all of which reflects the estimated impact associated with the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability at the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. SAB 118 provided guidance which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to finalize the recording of any related tax impacts. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the act, finalizing our analysis of the act and subsequent guidance issued by the U.S. As a result, we recorded a $290 million non-cash tax charge, reducing deferred tax assets relating to foreign currency translation. Topic 220 On January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 220. See Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, of Recent Accounting Pronouncements, of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further discussion of this standard. As a result of the adoption of this standard, we recorded a reclassification of $417 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings within stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restructuring Charges 2015 Restructuring Plan During the first quarter of 2015, we performed a comprehensive review of our processes, businesses and systems in a company-wide effort to improve performance, cut costs, and reduce spending. This restructuring plan was completed in the second quarter of 2016. Restructuring Reserve Severance As of December 31, 2016, an accrued severance balance of $17 million was included in other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and was paid during 2017. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees Guarantees Issued and Credit Facilities Available In addition to the default fund contributions and margin collateral pledged by clearing members discussed in Note 15, Clearing Operations, we have obtained financial guarantees and credit facilities which are guaranteed by us through counter indemnities, to provide further liquidity related to our clearing businesses. Financial guarantees issued to us totaled $12 million as of December 31, 2018 and $14 million as of December 31, 2017 . As discussed in Other Credit Facilities, of Note 9, Debt Obligations, clearing-related credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, totaled $220 million as of December 31, 2018 and $187 million as of December 31, 2017 , in available liquidity, none of which was utilized.

In the first quarter of 2018, the Lower Administrative Court denied our appeal. We have appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal.

Execution Access is an introducing broker which operates the trading platform for our Fixed Income business to trade in U.S.. Execution Access has a clearing arrangement with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Financial Services LLC, or ICBC. As of December 31, 2018 , we have contributed $15 million of clearing deposits to ICBC in connection with this clearing arrangement. These deposits are recorded in other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Some of the trading activity in Execution Access is cleared by ICBC through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, with ICBC acting as agent. Execution Access assumes the counterparty risk of clients that do not clear through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. Counterparty risk of clients exists for Execution Access between the trade date and the settlement date of the individual transactions, which is at least one business day (or more, if specified by the U.S. We believe that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is mitigated through the pledged collateral and our risk management policies. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these arrangements. However, no guarantee can be provided that these arrangements will at all times be sufficient. Some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and escalation clauses based on increases in property taxes and building operating costs. Other Guarantees Through our clearing operations in the financial markets, Nasdaq Clearing is the legal counterparty for, and guarantees the performance of, its clearing members. We have provided a guarantee related to lease obligations for The Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, Inc., which is a not-for-profit organization designed to convene, connect and engage aspiring and current entrepreneurs. This entity is not included in the consolidated financial statements of Nasdaq. We believe that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is unlikely. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above guarantees. Non-Cash Contingent Consideration As part of the purchase price consideration of a prior acquisition, we have agreed to future annual issuances of 992,247 shares of Nasdaq common stock which approximated certain tax benefits associated with the transaction. Such contingent future issuances of Nasdaq common stock will be paid ratably through 2027 if Nasdaqs total gross revenues equal or exceed $25 million in each such year. The contingent future issuances of Nasdaq common stock are subject to anti-dilution protections and acceleration upon certain events. Escrow Agreements In connection with prior acquisitions, we entered into escrow agreements to secure the payment of post-closing adjustments and to ensure other closing conditions. As of December 31, 2018 , these escrow agreements provide for future payment of $12 million which is included in other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Routing Brokerage Activities One of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services, provides a guarantee to securities clearinghouses and exchanges under its standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. If a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to a clearinghouse or exchange, other members would be required to meet its shortfalls. To mitigate these performance risks, the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral, as well as meet certain minimum financial standards. Nasdaq Execution Services maximum potential liability under these arrangements cannot be quantified.

As previously disclosed, we are named as one of many defendants in City of Providence v. BATS Global Markets, Inc., et al., 14 Civ. 2811 (S.D.N.Y.), which was filed on April 18, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The district court appointed lead counsel, who. filed an amended complaint on September 2, 2014. The amended complaint names as defendants seven national exchanges, as well as Barclays PLC, which operated a private alternative trading system. On behalf of a putative class of securities traders, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a scheme to manipulate the markets through high-frequency trading; the amended complaint asserts claims against us under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, as well as under Section 6(b) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek injunctive and monetary relief of an unspecified amount. We filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on November 3, 2014. In response, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on November 24, 2014, which names the same defendants and alleges essentially the same violations. We then filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on January 23, 2015. On August 26, 2015, the district court entered an order dismissing the second amended complaint in its entirety with prejudice, concluding that most of the plaintiffs theories were foreclosed by absolute immunity and in any event that the plaintiffs failed to state any claim. The plaintiffs appealed the judgment of dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On December 19, 2017, the Second Circuit issued an opinion vacating the district courts judgment of dismissal and remanding to the district court for further proceedings. The exchanges filed a petition before the Second Circuit seeking panel or en banc rehearing on January 31, 2018, which the Second Circuit denied on March 13, 2018. On May 18, 2018, the exchanges filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, raising issues not addressed in the proceedings to date. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, we are unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation. However, we believe that the claims are without merit and will continue to litigate vigorously.. During September 2018, a clearing member of Nasdaq Clearing's commodities market was declared in default. Consistent with our regulatory obligations, we notified all relevant regulators and are cooperating fully with information requests. We are engaging in discussions with the other members regarding the default and recovery process towards the defaulting member. We are unable to predict the outcome or exact timing of this matter. See Nasdaq Commodities Clearing Default, of Note 15, Clearing Operations, for further information on this event.. In recent years, certain industry groups have challenged the level of fees that U.S. exchanges charge for market data and. Except as disclosed above and in prior reports filed under the Exchange Act, we are not currently a party to any litigation or proceeding that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, or operating results. However, from time to time, we have been threatened with, or named as a defendant in, lawsuits or involved in regulatory proceedings.. In the normal course of business, Nasdaq discusses matters with its regulators raised during regulatory examinations or otherwise subject to their inquiries. Management believes that censures, fines, penalties or other sanctions that could result from any ongoing examinations or inquiries will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. We are engaged in ongoing discussions and audits with taxing authorities on various tax matters, the resolutions of which are uncertain. Currently, there are matters that may lead to assessments, some of which may not be resolved for several years. Based on currently available information, we believe we have adequately provided for any assessments that could result from those proceedings where it is more likely than not that we will be assessed. We review our positions on these matters as they progress. See Tax Audits, of Note 17, Income Taxes, for further discussion.. We manage, operate and provide our products and services in four business segments: Market Services, Corporate Services, Information Services and Market Technology. In early 2018, we realigned our businesses to better serve the needs of our corporate clients. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of 2018, our BWise internal audit, regulatory compliance management, and operational risk management software solutions are now offered as part of governance, risk & compliance products and services within our Corporate. BWise was previously part of our Market Technology segment. We have restated prior periods to conform to the current year presentation.. Our management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages these businesses as four separate segments. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is operating income. Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and structure.. These items include the following: 2018 Divestiture: We have included in corporate items the revenues and expenses of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses which were part of the Corporate Solutions business within our Corporate Services segment as these businesses were sold in April 2018. See 2018 Divestiture, of Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestiture, for further discussion. Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the segments, and the relative operating performance of the segments between periods. Management does not consider intangible asset amortization expense for the purpose of evaluating the performance of our segments or their managers or when making decisions to allocate resources. Therefore, we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide management with a more useful representation of our segments' ongoing activity in each period. Merger and strategic initiatives expense: We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed a divestiture and a number of acquisitions in recent years which have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs. These items include the following: 2018 Divestiture: We have included in corporate items the revenues and expenses of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses which were part of the Corporate Solutions business within our Corporate Services segment as these businesses were sold in April 2018.

"Nasdaq Inc. and Cboe Global Markets Inc. on Friday sued the Securities and Exchange Commission in a federal appeals court to stop the regulator from carrying out the program, a day after the New York Stock Exchange filed a similar challenge. Nasdaq, NYSE and Cboe say it would harm investors and listed companies by widening \"bid-ask spreads\" -- the difference between the price at which a stock can be bought and the price at which it can be sold. The exchanges have also voiced concern that it would cause trading to shift to off-exchange \"dark pools,\" private trading platforms often run by banks. This would diminish the transparency of stock prices, the exchanges say, while hurting their bottom lines. Almost 40% of U.S. equities trading volume takes place outside of exchanges, according to data from Cboe. \"'Do no harm' is clearly a mandate for the exchanges and the SEC, and this could certainly do harm,\" Nelson Griggs, executive vice president for corporate services at Nasdaq, said in an interview Friday. Nasdaq's filing on Friday was a terse petition asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC rule mandating the pilot program."
"The company had said in its annual report that it believed the likelihood of SEC overturning its prior final order is remote. It said that if this happened, it would have to return cash to its three owners: Intercontinental Exchange Inc.s New York Stock Exchange, Cboe Global Markets Inc. and Nasdaq Inc. An OCC spokesman declined to comment on the SEC decision. Opponents had criticized the plan, saying it increased trading costs and benefited the three shareholder exchanges, which created an uneven playing field in the fiercely competitive options industry. Big options-trading firms like Susquehanna International Group LLP and Virtu Financial Inc. sued the SEC in 2016 for approving the plan. In 2017, a federal appeals court ordered the SEC to review its decision again, which ultimately led to Wednesdays rejection."
"Euronext NV stepped up a struggle with Nasdaq Inc. for control of Oslo Bors, raising its bid for Norway?s main stock exchange to about $790 million. The Franco-Dutch exchange operator is now willing to pay 158 Norwegian kroner a share, which is about 4 percent more than Nasdaq bid last month. It?s also about 9 percent higher than Euronext?s own previous offer. The development drew assurances from Nasdaq, which said on Monday it remains committed to moving ahead with a deal after already winning the backing of the Oslo Bors board. But the U.S. exchange operator has so far stopped short of signaling it?s ready to raise its price. Bente Landsnes Bente Landsnes, the chief executive officer of Oslo Bors, said she and her team will now evaluate Euronext?s new offer, but reiterated her view that Nasdaq remains a better strategic fit. [...] ?that the Norwegian capital market and our companies will have a better future with an ownership of Nasdaq,? KLP and DNB, Oslo Bors?s two biggest shareholders, said on Monday they want Nasdaq to succeed, underscoring the backing they already gave the U.S. firm last month. But the question is whether other shareholders in Oslo Bors will be content with a lower bid than the one Euronext just put on the table. As things stand now, Euronext has secured the backing of shareholders representing just over half Oslo Bors?s stock, while Nasdaq has holders with about a third of the shares behind its offer. Publishing its offer document on Feb. 4, Nasdaq revealed that it had control of 35.2 percent of Oslo Bors. For its part, Nasdaq has argued that its dominance in the Nordic markets -- where it already operates exchanges in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland -- make it a more natural fit for Oslo Bors."

"On January 29, 2019, Nasdaq AB (the Offeror), a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Sweden and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq, Inc. (Nasdaq), entered into a Transaction Agreement (the Transaction Agreement) with Oslo B?rs VPS Holding ASA (Oslo B?rs VPS), a public limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Norway.. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the Offeror will commence a voluntary tender offer (the Offer) to purchase all issued and outstanding shares in Oslo B?rs VPS (the Shares) at an offer price per Share of NOK 152 (the Offer Price). Oslo B?rs VPS shareholders that accept the Offer will also receive an interest payment of 6% per annum on the Offer Price, pro-rated per day from January 29, 2019 until the closing conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreement (the Closing Conditions) have been satisfied or waived. The Offer Price is subject to adjustment to match any higher price for Shares that the Offeror pays prior to the expiry of the offer period or in the period until the later of December 31, 2019 and six months from completion of the Offer. Further, if the Offeror sells any Shares in the period until the later of December 31, 2019 and six months from completion of the Offer at a price higher than the Offer Price, the net profit from any such sales will be distributed to tendering Oslo B?rs VPS shareholders on a pro rata basis. The Offer Price will be reduced by the amount of any dividends or other distributions declared on the Oslo B?rs VPS Shares after January 29, 2019.. Prior to the execution of the Transaction Agreement, the Offeror received irrevocable pre-acceptances of the Offer from certain of Oslo B?rs VPS shareholders, in aggregate representing 35.11% of the Shares.. The Offerors obligation to complete the Offer is subject to satisfaction or waiver of the Closing Conditions, including, among others, (i) the Offer having been accepted by holders of more than 90% (or such lower percentage as the Offeror may determine in its sole discretion) of the Shares, (ii) the unanimous recommendation of the Oslo B?rs VPS board of directors (the Board) in favor of the Offer being issued and not withdrawn, amended or qualified in any manner adverse to the Offeror, (iii) the Offeror having completed limited confirmatory due diligence to the Offerors satisfaction, (iv) certain regulatory clearances having been obtained, (v) no Material Adverse Change (as defined in the Transaction Agreement) having occurred since the date of the Transaction Agreement, and (vi) Oslo B?rs VPS having not materially breached the Transaction Agreement.. If the Closing Conditions are satisfied or waived and the Offeror has acquired at least 90% of the Shares, the Offeror will complete a compulsory acquisition of the remaining Shares as soon as practicable in accordance with Norwegian law.. The Board has undertaken to unanimously recommend that shareholders of Oslo B?rs VPS accept the Offer. The Board may not withdraw, modify or amend its recommendation of the Offer. In the event that the Board determines that an unsolicited offer from another bidder is a Higher Priced Offer (as defined in the Transaction Agreement), the Offeror will have the opportunity to match such Higher Priced Offer for a period of five business days. If, during the matching period, the Offeror does not amend the Offer so that the Offer Price is as high as the offer price in the Higher Priced Offer and the amended Offer is otherwise on terms not significantly less favorable than the terms of the Offer on the date of the Transaction Agreement, the Board may acknowledge that the Higher Priced Offer is more favorable from a purely financial point of view than the Offer. The Transaction Agreement includes representations, warranties and covenants of the Offeror and Oslo B?rs VPS customary in Norwegian transactions of this nature. During the pendency of the Offer, Oslo B?rs VPS has agreed to conduct itself in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, pursuant to plans that have been publicly disclosed or disclosed in writing to the Offeror prior to date of the Transaction Agreement and in accordance with applicable law, including the requirements to comply with the Oslo B?rs VPS groups permits from relevant authorities.. Oslo B?rs VPS may enter negotiations if it receives an unsolicited competing offer, but only if the Board determines that such competing offer is likely to result in a Higher Priced Offer and not responding to such offer would be a breach of its fiduciary duties.. If the 90% (or such lower percentage as the Offeror may determine in its sole discretion) minimum acceptance Closing Condition has not been satisfied by the end of the offer period, the Offeror may, in its sole discretion, elect to seek to satisfy such Closing Condition by re-opening the offer period (to no later than December 31, 2019) or by other adequate means.. Either the Offeror or Oslo B?rs VPS may terminate the Transaction Agreement in the event there is an uncured material breach, if the Offeror has publicly announced that a Closing Condition is or becomes incapable of being satisfied and will not be waived by the Offeror or if the Offeror has not publicly announced the satisfaction or waiver of the Closing Conditions by December 31, 2019. The Offeror may also terminate the Transaction Agreement if the Board amends, modifies or withdraws its recommendation of the Offer without the Offerors consent..
